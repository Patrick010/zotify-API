# Snitch Module: Code Quality Index

## 1. Purpose

This document serves as a central registry for the quality status of all source code files within the **Snitch** module. It provides a live snapshot of our code quality, helping to identify areas that need improvement or refactoring.

## 2. Scoring Rubric

Each file is assigned a quality score based on a holistic assessment.

-   **A (Excellent):** The code is clear, efficient, and easy to maintain. It has comprehensive documentation, including a module-level docstring, detailed function/class docstrings, and inline comments for complex logic.
-   **B (Good):** The code is functional but could be improved. It may have basic documentation but lacks detail. Some complex areas might be uncommented or hard to follow.
-   **C (Needs Improvement):** The code is difficult to understand and has little to no documentation.

## 3. Source Code Index

| File Path | Code Quality Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `snitch/snitch.go` | B | Excellent inline comments and descriptive logging make the implementation easy to follow. A score of 'A' would require function-level comments explaining the purpose and parameters of `main` and `loginHandler`. |
