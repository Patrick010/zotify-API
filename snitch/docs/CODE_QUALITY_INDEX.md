# Snitch Module: Code Quality Index

## 1. Purpose

This document serves as a central registry for the quality status of all source code files within the **Snitch** module. It provides a live snapshot of our code quality, helping to identify areas that need improvement or refactoring.

## 2. Scoring Rubric

Each file is assigned two quality scores: one for Documentation and one for Code.

### Documentation Score (`Doc Score`)
This score assesses the quality and completeness of the comments and docstrings.
-   **A (Excellent):** The file has a comprehensive module-level docstring. All functions have detailed docstrings/comments covering their goals and parameters.
-   **B (Good):** The file has basic docstrings for the module and most functions, but they may lack detail.
-   **C (Needs Improvement):** The file has missing or minimal docstrings and inline comments.

### Code Quality Score (`Code Score`)
This score assesses the quality of the implementation itself.
-   **A (Excellent):** The code is clear, efficient, well-structured, and adheres to design patterns.
-   **B (Good):** The code is functional but could be improved (e.g., contains some complex or hard-to-follow logic).
-   **C (Needs Improvement):** The code is difficult to understand, inefficient, or contains significant technical debt.

## 3. Source Code Index

| File Path | Doc Score | Code Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `snitch/snitch.go` | B | B | Excellent inline comments and a clear module-level comment. Lacks function-level docstrings. The code is clear and functional but could be slightly better structured. |
