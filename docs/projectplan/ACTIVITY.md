## Task: Align OAuth2 for Spotify Integration Documentation

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** âœ… Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To update the project's design documents to accurately reflect the current, partial implementation of the Spotify OAuth2 integration.

### Outcome
- The `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` and `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` were updated to show that playlist CRUD is functional, but write-sync and full library management are not implemented. This closed the documentation gap.

## Task: Align Error Handling & Logging Documentation

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** âœ… Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To update the project's design documents to accurately describe the current, ad-hoc implementation of error handling and logging.

### Outcome
- The `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` was updated to reflect the current state. The "ideal" design was moved to `FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`. The `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` was updated to close the documentation gap.

### Related Documents
- `docs/projectplan/audit/AUDIT-PHASE-3.md` (Task 3)

## Task: Implement Downloads Subsystem Queue Processor

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** âœ… Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To implement the initial, in-memory version of the download job queue as specified in the design documents.

### Outcome
- A functional, in-memory job queue was added to the `DownloadsService`. The `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` and `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` were updated to reflect this progress, noting that a persistent queue is still required.

### Related Documents
- `docs/projectplan/audit/AUDIT-PHASE-3.md` (Task 2)

### Related Documents
- `docs/projectplan/audit/AUDIT-PHASE-3.md` (Task 1)
