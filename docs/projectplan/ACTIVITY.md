**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

## Task: Implement Persistent Download Queue

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** âœ… Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To replace the temporary in-memory download queue with a persistent, database-backed queue using SQLite. This will address the highest-priority gap in the `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` and make the downloads subsystem production-ready.

## Task: Review and Synchronize Audit Documentation

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** âœ… Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To perform a comprehensive review of all planning and audit documents to ensure alignment and identify any leftover issues before proceeding with further audit tasks. This task was mandated to ensure full context and synchronization with the project's goals.

### Outcome
- The review confirmed that the project documentation is well-aligned. A minor ambiguity around "User system wiring" was identified for future clarification. The new `ACTIVITY.md` log was created and the process was validated.

## Task: Align OAuth2 for Spotify Integration Documentation

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** âœ… Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To update the project's design documents to accurately reflect the current, partial implementation of the Spotify OAuth2 integration.

### Outcome
- The `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` and `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` were updated to show that playlist CRUD is functional, but write-sync and full library management are not implemented. This closed the documentation gap.

### Related Documents
- `docs/projectplan/audit/AUDIT-PHASE-3.md` (Task 4)

## Task: Align Error Handling & Logging Documentation

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** âœ… Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To update the project's design documents to accurately describe the current, ad-hoc implementation of error handling and logging.

### Outcome
- The `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` was updated to reflect the current state. The "ideal" design was moved to `FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`. The `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` was updated to close the documentation gap.

### Related Documents
- `docs/projectplan/audit/AUDIT-PHASE-3.md` (Task 3)

## Task: Implement Downloads Subsystem Queue Processor

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** âœ… Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To implement the initial, in-memory version of the download job queue as specified in the design documents.

### Outcome
- A functional, in-memory job queue was added to the `DownloadsService`. The `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` and `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` were updated to reflect this progress, noting that a persistent queue is still required.

### Related Documents
- `docs/projectplan/audit/AUDIT-PHASE-3.md` (Task 2)

## Task: Align Admin Endpoint Security Documentation

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** âœ… Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To create and update the security documentation to match the current implementation of a static admin API key.

### Outcome
- A new `docs/projectplan/security.md` file was created and the `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` was updated to close the documentation gap.

### Related Documents
- `docs/projectplan/audit/AUDIT-PHASE-3.md` (Task 1)
- `docs/projectplan/security.md`
