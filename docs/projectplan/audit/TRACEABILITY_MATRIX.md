# HLD/LLD Traceability Matrix

**Purpose:** This document tracks the alignment between the features and architectural principles described in the `HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` and `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` documents and the actual state of the codebase.

| Feature / Component | Exists in Codebase? (Y/N) | Matches Design? (Y/N) | Notes on Deviations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High-Level Architecture (from HLD)** | | | |
| Dedicated Service Layer Architecture | Y | Y | The codebase correctly separates routes, services, and schemas as designed. |
| Documentation-first Workflow | N | N | This process was not followed, leading to the documentation drift that prompted the audit. |
| Test Coverage > 90% | N | N | Test coverage is present but well below the 90% target. Coverage enforcement is not wired into the CI pipeline. |
| Admin Endpoint Security | Y | N | API key check exists, but design specifies layered security (e.g., rate limiting, secondary auth) which is not implemented. |
| CI/CD Pipeline | Y | Y | The `.github/workflows` directory and project config show that ruff, mypy, bandit, and pytest are configured. |
| OAuth2 for Spotify Integration | Y | N | Core auth flow is implemented, but post-auth CRUD/sync functionality is incomplete compared to design. |
| JWT for API Authentication | N | N | This is a core design requirement that is not implemented. |
| **Service Refactor Status (from LLD)** | | | The LLD claims all 18 steps are complete, but the audit shows this is false. |
| Search Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| Sync Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| Config Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| Playlists Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| Tracks Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| **Downloads Subsystem** | Y | N | The LLD assumed full workflow integration, but current code only has route stubs with no backing service logic. |
| Logging Subsystem | Y | N | Basic logging exists, but standardized error models and audit trails specified in the design are not implemented. |
| Cache Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| Network Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| Metadata Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| User Profiles Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| Notifications Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| Authentication & Admin Controls | Y | Y | The core admin API key system is functional. |
| **System Info & Health Endpoints**| Y | N | Partially implemented. `uptime`/`env` are functional, but design includes process stats, disk/network health, and dependency checks which are missing. |

## Known Experiential Gaps (Task 1.3)

The following are known areas of mismatch identified outside of direct document-vs-code comparison:

- **Authentication & Authorization:** The design specifies JWT-based auth and 2FA plans, but the current codebase mostly uses placeholders and partial implementations.
- **Spotify Integration:** The design aims for full CRUD and sync support, but write-sync is incomplete, and webhook support is missing.
- **Documentation Practices:** The design mandates a docs-first workflow; in reality, docs have lagged significantly, causing confusion.
- **Error Handling & Logging:** The design expects consistent error models and audit logs; the code has some gaps and inconsistent logging.
- **Security Features:** Some security enhancements like secret rotation and TLS hardening are in design but not yet reflected in code.
