# AUDIT-phase-3: Incremental Design Updates

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Author:** Jules
**Objective:** To track the incremental updates to design documents to bring them into alignment with the codebase reality, as outlined in the HLD/LLD Alignment Plan.

## 1. Task: Align Admin Endpoint Security Documentation

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** ✅ Done

### 1.1. Problem

The `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a high-priority gap for "Admin Endpoint Security". The existing design documents were pointing to a non-existent `security.md` file and contained outdated information about the security model.

### 1.2. Changes Made

1.  **Created `docs/projectplan/security.md`:** A new, definitive security document was created by copying the archived (pre-audit) version and updating it to reflect the current implementation.
    *   The document now clearly separates the **Current Security Model** (static admin API key) from the **Future Enhancements** (JWT, rate limiting, etc.).
2.  **Updated `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`:** The entry for "Admin Endpoint Security" was updated to `Matches Design? = Y`, closing the documentation gap.
3.  **Updated `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md`:** The plan was updated to mark the beginning of Phase 3.

### 1.3. Outcome

The project's security documentation is now accurate and aligned with the current state of the codebase. This completes the first task of Phase 3.

## 2. Task: Implement Downloads Subsystem Queue Processor

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** ✅ Done

### 2.1. Problem

The `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a high-priority gap for the "Downloads Subsystem". The design specified a functional job queue, but the codebase only contained stubs.

### 2.2. Changes Made

1.  **Code Implementation:**
    *   Added `process_download_queue()` method to `DownloadsService` to process one job from the queue.
    *   Added a manual trigger endpoint `POST /api/download/process`.
    *   Fixed a bug in the `retry_failed_jobs` logic.
2.  **Testing:**
    *   Added a comprehensive test suite for the new functionality. All project tests pass.
3.  **Documentation Updates:**
    *   Updated `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` to reflect the new implementation.
    *   Updated `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` to mark the gap as partially closed.
    *   Updated `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` and `ROADMAP.md` to reflect the progress.

### 2.3. Outcome

The "Downloads Subsystem" now has a functional, in-memory job queue, closing the initial implementation gap. This completes this task as another item in the Alignment Plan's Phase 3.

## 3. Task: Align Error Handling & Logging Documentation

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** ✅ Done

### 3.1. Problem

The `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a medium-priority gap for "Error Handling & Logging". The implementation was inconsistent and did not match the ideal design of standardized error schemas and audit trails.

### 3.2. Changes Made

1.  **Investigation:** Analyzed the codebase to document the current ad-hoc implementation of error handling and logging.
2.  **`FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`:** Added the "ideal" design for standardized error handling and logging to this document.
3.  **`LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md`:** Added a new design section to accurately describe the current, inconsistent implementation.
4.  **`TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`:** Updated the entry for "Error Handling & Logging" to `Matches Design? = Y`, closing the documentation gap.

### 3.3. Outcome

The project's design documents now accurately reflect the current state of the error handling and logging system. The aspirational, standardized design is captured as a future goal. This completes this task as another item in the Alignment Plan's Phase 3.
