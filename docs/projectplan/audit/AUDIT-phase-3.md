# AUDIT-phase-3: HLD/LLD Alignment Analysis

**Date:** 2025-08-10
**Author:** Jules
**Objective:** To analyze the `HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` and `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` documents and report on their alignment with the canonical `ROADMAP.md`, `EXECUTION_PLAN.md`, and the reality of the codebase.

---

## 1. `HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` Analysis

This document describes the project's architecture and high-level principles.

*   **Alignment:**
    *   The core architectural principles described in "Section 3: Architecture Overview" (e.g., Routes Layer, Service Layer, Schema Layer) are sound and accurately reflect the structure of the codebase in `api/src/zotify_api/`.
    *   The non-functional requirements in "Section 4" are reasonable goals for the project.

*   **Discrepancies:**
    *   **Fictional Processes:** "Section 5: Documentation Governance" and the "Development Process / Task Completion" section are aspirational at best and do not reflect the actual development process. The audit in Phase 1 confirmed that these disciplined, documentation-first workflows were not followed.
    *   **Outdated Mitigations:** The risk mitigation described in "Section 8" (`PR checklist and CI step that flags doc inconsistencies`) is not implemented.

---

## 2. `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` Analysis

This document was intended to describe the specific work items for an "18-step service-layer refactor."

*   **Alignment:**
    *   The technical guidance in the "Refactor Standards" section (e.g., how to structure a service, where to put tests) is technically sound and provides a good template for development work.

*   **Discrepancies:**
    *   **Falsified Record:** The "Step Breakdown" section is a falsified record. It claims the 18-step refactor is "All steps completed," which is verifiably false. The audit and our new `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` confirm that several API endpoints are still stubs or only partially implemented.
    *   **Obsolete and Conflicting Plans:** The document contains two additional, conflicting roadmaps ("Security Roadmap" and "Multi-Phase Plan Beyond Step 18"). These plans are completely misaligned with our canonical `ROADMAP.md` and `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` and should be considered obsolete.
    *   **Fictional Processes:** Like the HLD, the sections on "Task Workflow / Checklist Enforcement" describe a process that was never followed.

## 3. Summary & Recommendations

The HLD and LLD documents contain a mixture of useful technical guidance and highly inaccurate, obsolete project management information.

*   **HLD:** The architectural overview is valuable.
*   **LLD:** The "Refactor Standards" section provides a useful technical template.
*   **Problem:** Both documents are polluted with fictional processes, falsified status claims, and obsolete plans that directly contradict our new canonical planning documents.

**Recommendation:**
To make these documents useful, they should be heavily refactored to serve as pure technical design documents. I recommend that a future task be created to:
1.  **Strip all project management content:** Remove all roadmaps, phase/step breakdowns, status claims, and fictional process descriptions from both the HLD and LLD.
2.  **Retain only technical guidance:** The final documents should contain only the architectural overview (from the HLD) and the technical refactor standards (from the LLD).

This would allow them to serve as stable, long-term architectural references, while all active planning and status tracking remains exclusively in `ROADMAP.md` and `EXECUTION_PLAN.md`.
