**Author:** Jules
**Objective:** To track the incremental updates to design documents to bring them into alignment with the codebase reality, as outlined in the HLD/LLD Alignment Plan.

## 1. Task: Align Admin Endpoint Security Documentation

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** âœ… Done

### 1.1. Problem

The `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a high-priority gap for "Admin Endpoint Security". The existing design documents were pointing to a non-existent `security.md` file and contained outdated information about the security model.

### 1.2. Changes Made

1.  **Created `docs/projectplan/security.md`:** A new, definitive security document was created by copying the archived (pre-audit) version and updating it to reflect the current implementation.
    *   The document now clearly separates the **Current Security Model** (static admin API key) from the **Future Enhancements** (JWT, rate limiting, etc.).
2.  **Updated `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`:** The entry for "Admin Endpoint Security" was updated to `Matches Design? = Y`, closing the documentation gap.
3.  **Updated `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md`:** The plan was updated to mark the beginning of Phase 3.

### 1.3. Outcome

The project's security documentation is now accurate and aligned with the current state of the codebase. This completes the first task of Phase 3.
