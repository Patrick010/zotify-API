Users have the right to access and delete their personal data. We will provide a mechanism for users to request a copy of their data and to delete their account and all associated data.

## 4. GDPR Compliance

The Zotify API is designed to be compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This includes:

*   **Data Protection by Design and by Default:** We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that data protection is integrated into our services from the outset.
