# HLD/LLD Traceability Matrix

**Purpose:** This document tracks the alignment between the features and architectural principles described in the `HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` and `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` documents and the actual state of the codebase.

| Feature / Component | Exists in Codebase? (Y/N) | Matches Design? (Y/N) | Notes on Deviations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High-Level Architecture (from HLD)** | | | |
| Dedicated Service Layer Architecture | Y | Y | The codebase correctly separates routes, services, and schemas as designed. |
| Documentation-first Workflow | N | N | This process was not followed, leading to the documentation drift that prompted the audit. |
| Test Coverage > 90% | N | N | Test coverage is present but well below the 90% target. |
| Admin Endpoint Security | Y | Y | The `require_admin_api_key` dependency provides authentication for admin endpoints. |
| CI/CD Pipeline | Y | Y | The `.github/workflows` directory and project config show that ruff, mypy, bandit, and pytest are configured. |
| OAuth2 for Spotify Integration | Y | Y | The core logic for the Spotify OAuth2 flow is implemented. |
| JWT for API Authentication | N | N | This is listed as a future step in the HLD and is not implemented. |
| **Service Refactor Status (from LLD)** | | | The LLD claims all 18 steps are complete, but the audit shows this is false. |
| Search Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| Sync Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| Config Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| Playlists Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| Tracks Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| **Downloads Subsystem** | Y | N | The endpoints exist but are **stubs**. The service logic is incomplete. |
| Logging Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| Cache Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| Network Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| Metadata Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| User Profiles Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| Notifications Subsystem | Y | Y | Functional. |
| Authentication & Admin Controls | Y | Y | The core admin API key system is functional. |
| **System Info & Health Endpoints**| Y | N | This is only partially implemented. `uptime` and `env` are functional, but other endpoints are **stubs**. |
