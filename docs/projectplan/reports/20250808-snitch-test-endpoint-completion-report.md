# Task Completion Report: Snitch Test Endpoint

**Date:** 2025-08-08
**Author:** Jules
**Related Task:** Implement Test Endpoint for Snitch

---

## 1. Summary of Work

This report details the completion of the task to create a temporary test endpoint to verify Snitch's forwarding behavior. The goal was to have an endpoint that can receive a POST request with `code` and `state`, log the payload, and respond with a dummy JSON response to facilitate manual validation of the authentication chain.

---

## 2. Changes Implemented

### a. Debug Router
- A new debug router was created in `api/src/zotify_api/routes/debug.py`.
- The router is prefixed with `/auth/debug`.

### b. New Endpoint (`/auth/debug/snitch_test`)
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Path:** `/auth/debug/snitch_test`
- **Payload:** A Pydantic model `SnitchTestPayload` was created to validate the incoming JSON, ensuring it contains `code: str` and `state: str`.
- **Logic:**
    - The endpoint receives the JSON payload.
    - It logs the `code` and `state` values using the standard Python logging module.
    - It returns a JSON response: `{ "status": "ok", "received": { "code": "...", "state": "..." } }`.

### c. Application Integration
- The new debug router was mounted under the main FastAPI app in `api/src/zotify_api/main.py`.

## 3. Documentation Updates

- As this is a temporary, internal-facing test endpoint, no user-facing documentation (e.g., `MANUAL.md`, `HLD`, `LLD`) was updated.
- This report serves as the primary documentation for this task, in accordance with `task_checklist.md`.

---

## 4. Outcome

The API now has a temporary endpoint that can be used to validate that the Go-based `snitch` listener is correctly forwarding payloads to the backend. This allows for isolated testing of the `snitch` component. The endpoint will be removed after the full authentication flow is validated.
