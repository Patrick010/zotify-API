**Related Task:** Refactor and unify the Spotify OAuth flow (PKCE)

## 1. Summary of Work

This report details the completion of a major refactoring effort to unify the Spotify OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE. The primary goal was to establish a clear, robust, and maintainable architecture for user authentication, clarifying the roles of the Go-based `snitch` listener and the Python-based FastAPI backend.

## 2. Changes Implemented

### a. Snitch (Go Client)
- **Role:** Refactored to act as a minimal, single-purpose redirect listener and forwarder.
- **Listener:** Now listens exclusively on `GET http://127.0.0.1:4381/login`, the fixed redirect URI required by Spotify.
- **Forwarding:** Upon receiving a valid callback from Spotify, it extracts the `code` and `state` parameters, logs them to the console for debugging, and forwards them in a JSON `POST` request to a fixed endpoint on the FastAPI backend (`http://192.168.20.5/auth/spotify/callback`).
- **User Feedback:** Provides a simple HTML response in the user's browser to indicate success or failure.
- **Testing:** Unit tests were rewritten to validate the new forwarding logic.

### b. FastAPI Backend (Python)
- **Role:** Now handles all state management, PKCE logic, and communication with the Spotify API.
- **New Endpoint (`/auth/spotify/start`):**
  - Initiates the OAuth flow.
  - Generates and stores a `state` and `code_verifier` pair (using the `pkce` library).
  - Constructs and returns the full Spotify authorization URL, including the `code_challenge` and `code_challenge_method=S256`.
- **New Endpoint (`/auth/spotify/callback`):**
  - Receives the `code` and `state` from Snitch.
  - Validates the `state` and retrieves the corresponding `code_verifier`.
  - Performs the token exchange by making a `POST` request to `https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token` with all required parameters, including the `code_verifier`.
  - (Simulated) Securely stores the received access and refresh tokens.
- **Dependencies:** All newly required Python packages (`pkce`, `httpx`, `respx`, `pydantic-settings`, `sqlalchemy`, `python-multipart`) were added to `pyproject.toml` to ensure a reproducible environment.

### c. Testing
- A new integration test file, `api/tests/test_auth_flow.py`, was created.
- The test was adapted from the user's prompt to fit the new two-part architecture by simulating the actions of Snitch.
- It successfully verifies the entire backend flow, from generating the auth URL to exchanging the code for a token, using a mocked Spotify token endpoint.

## 3. Documentation Updates

In accordance with the `task_checklist.md`, the following documentation was updated:
- **`snitch/README.md`**: Updated to reflect Snitch's new role and usage.
- **`api/docs/MANUAL.md`**: The main API manual was updated with a detailed description of the new authentication flow and the new `/auth/spotify/start` and `/auth/spotify/callback` endpoints.
- **`docs/projectplan/next_steps_and_phases.md`**: Updated to track the completion of this major refactoring task.
- **`docs/projectplan/task_checklist.md`**: This checklist was followed throughout the task.
- **HLD/LLD**: Reviewed, and no changes were deemed necessary as the implementation aligns with the existing architectural plans.

## 4. Outcome

The project's OAuth flow is now unified, secure, and robust. The roles of each component are clearly defined, and the implementation uses the modern PKCE standard. The codebase is more maintainable, and the new integration test provides confidence in the backend's correctness.
