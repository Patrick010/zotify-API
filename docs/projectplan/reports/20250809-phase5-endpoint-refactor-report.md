## 1. Summary of Work Completed

This task focused on continuing Phase 5 of the Zotify API development by converting stubbed or partially-implemented endpoints into fully functional, robust implementations. The core of this effort involved refactoring all direct Spotify API calls into a centralized service client to improve architecture, maintainability, and error handling.

## 2. Key Changes and Implementations

### a. Architectural Refactoring

- **`SpotifyClient` Service:** A new `SpotifyClient` class was created in `api/src/zotify_api/services/spotify_client.py`. This class is now the single source for all interactions with the Spotify Web API. It handles request authentication, session management (`httpx.AsyncClient`), and standardized error handling.

### b. Endpoint Implementations

The following endpoints were refactored to use the new `SpotifyClient` via their respective service layers:

- **`POST /api/tracks/metadata`**: The endpoint's logic was moved from the route handler into the `tracks_service`, which now calls the `SpotifyClient`. This resolves the architectural issue and the potential for errors related to direct token management.
- **`GET /api/spotify/me`**: This endpoint was similarly refactored to use the `spotify_service` and the `SpotifyClient`.

### c. Testing Improvements

- **New Unit Tests:** Comprehensive unit tests were created for the new `SpotifyClient` to validate its functionality in isolation, using `unittest.mock` to patch `httpx` calls.
- **Endpoint Test Coverage:** New integration tests were added for the `/api/tracks/metadata` and `/api/spotify/me` endpoints to verify their behavior, authorization, and error handling.
- **Test Suite Stabilization:** A significant effort was made to diagnose and fix a series of underlying issues within the test environment. This included resolving dependency conflicts, `pytest` runner misconfigurations, and inconsistencies between different mocking libraries (`respx` vs. `unittest.mock`). All 138 tests are now passing, resulting in a more stable and reliable test suite.

## 3. Documentation Updates

- **Roadmap:** `docs/roadmap.md` was updated to reflect the completion of the refactoring work for the specified endpoints under Phase 5.
- **Changelog:** `api/docs/CHANGELOG.md` was updated with a new entry for `v0.1.31` detailing the changes.
- **Task Report:** This report was generated to formally document the completion of the task.

## 4. Compliance Checklist Verification

- **Security:** All changes were reviewed to ensure they adhere to the project's security standards. Existing authentication (`X-API-Key`) was preserved on all protected endpoints.
- **Privacy:** Handling of user data (`/me` profile) was reviewed to ensure no sensitive information is improperly stored or logged.
- **Code Quality:** The refactoring effort improves code quality by adhering to the established service-layer architecture, increasing modularity, and reducing code duplication.

This work establishes a clear and robust pattern for refactoring the remaining stubbed endpoints in Phase 5.
