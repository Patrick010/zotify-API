### **Task Completion Report: Spotify Integration Blueprint**

**Task:** Expand the Spotify Capability Audit into a full-stack, full-options Spotify Integration Blueprint.

**Status:** **Completed**

**Branch:** `feature/spotify-fullstack-blueprint`

**Summary of Work:**

This task involved the creation of a canonical document, `docs/projectplan/spotify_fullstack_capability_blueprint.md`, which serves as the master plan for all Spotify-related integration within the Zotify platform. The original `spotify_capability_audit.md` was updated to act as a pointer to this new, comprehensive blueprint.

The new blueprint provides a complete, top-to-bottom overview of the strategic and technical approach for integrating Spotify features, ensuring that Zotify can evolve into a full-featured developer platform.

**Key Deliverables Achieved:**

1.  **Expanded Feature Matrix:** The blueprint now contains three detailed tables outlining the capabilities of the **Spotify Web API**, **Librespot**, and the **Zotify Platform**. These tables clearly define each feature, its relevance, implementation status, and target API endpoint within Zotify.

2.  **Exhaustive Spotify Web API Endpoint Mapping:** A thorough audit of the Spotify Web API was conducted. The blueprint now contains a near-exhaustive list of all available endpoints, each mapped to its required authentication scope, relevant use cases, feasibility notes, and proposed Zotify API endpoint. This covers all major resource categories, including Albums, Artists, Tracks, Playlists, Audiobooks, Shows, and the Player API.

3.  **Librespot Module Breakdown:** A detailed breakdown of Librespot's core modules was created. This section clarifies the purpose of each module (e.g., Audio Streaming, Content Fetching, Device Control), its current usage within Zotify, and the plan for exposing its functionality through the Zotify API.

4.  **Planned API Feature List:** A high-level feature roadmap has been documented, outlining the major capabilities the Zotify API will support. Each feature includes a detailed description, the target user type (Developer, Admin, End-user), the underlying APIs involved, and concrete use cases.

5.  **Creative Use Case Inventory:** A list of advanced, developer-focused use cases has been compiled to demonstrate the full potential of the Zotify API. This includes examples like automated music archiving, integration with media servers like Plex, and the creation of third-party applications like Discord music bots.

6.  **API Design Guidelines:** A set of clear and specific API design principles has been established. This section provides concrete guidelines for API namespacing, authentication strategies (Spotify OAuth vs. internal tokens), the use of REST vs. WebSockets, and the handling of caching and rate limiting.

**Conclusion:**

The `spotify_fullstack_capability_blueprint.md` is now complete and meets all the requirements of the task. It provides the necessary architectural clarity and future-proofing to guide all subsequent development work on Spotify integration. This foundational document ensures that Zotify can be developed into a robust and flexible platform that fully leverages the capabilities of both the Spotify Web API and Librespot. This task can now be considered closed.
