# Task Completion Report: Phase 5 Search Implementation and Cleanup

**Date:** 2025-08-09
**Author:** Jules
**Version:** v0.1.33

---

## 1. Summary of Work Completed

This task continued the Phase 5 wrap-up by implementing the previously stubbed search functionality and removing a duplicate, legacy endpoint. This work further centralizes Spotify API interactions into the `SpotiClient` and cleans up the API surface.

## 2. Key Changes and Implementations

### a. Search Endpoint Implementation

- **`GET /api/search`**: This endpoint is now fully functional.
- **`SpotiClient` Enhancement**: A `search()` method was added to the client to handle the `GET /v1/search` Spotify API call.
- **Service Layer**: The `search_spotify()` service function was implemented to use the new client method. The entire call chain was made asynchronous to support the `httpx` client.

### b. Endpoint Removal

- **`GET /api/spotify/metadata/{track_id}`**: This redundant endpoint was removed from `api/src/zotify_api/routes/spotify.py` to eliminate code duplication and favor the `POST /api/tracks/metadata` endpoint. The corresponding test case was also removed.

### c. Testing

- A new unit test was added for the `SpotifyClient.search()` method.
- Existing integration tests for `/api/search` were updated to correctly mock the new asynchronous service layer and verify the complete functionality.
- An obsolete test for the removed metadata endpoint was deleted. All 140 tests in the suite are passing.

## 3. Documentation Sweep

As per the project's documentation requirements, a full review of all `.md` files (excluding `zotify/`) was performed.

### a. Files with Changes

- **`docs/roadmap.md`**: Updated to reflect the completion of the search endpoint implementation.
- **`api/docs/CHANGELOG.md`**: Added entry for `v0.1.33` detailing the search implementation and endpoint removal.
- **`docs/projectplan/reports/README.md`**: Will be updated to include this report.
