# Task Completion Report: New API Endpoints

**Date:** 2025-08-09

**Task:** Add a comprehensive set of new API endpoints to the Zotify API.

## Summary of Work

This task involved the implementation of several new API endpoints to extend the functionality of the Zotify API. The new endpoints cover authentication, Spotify integration, search, batch operations, and system diagnostics.

### Implemented Endpoints

*   **Authentication:**
    *   `GET /api/auth/status`
    *   `POST /api/auth/logout`
    *   `GET /api/auth/refresh`
*   **Spotify Integration:**
    *   `GET /api/spotify/me`
    *   `GET /api/spotify/devices`
*   **Search:**
    *   Extended `/api/search` with `type`, `limit`, and `offset` parameters.
*   **Batch & Bulk Operations:**
    *   `POST /api/tracks/metadata`
*   **System & Diagnostics:**
    *   `GET /api/system/uptime`
    *   `GET /api/system/env`
    *   `GET /api/schema`

### Key Features and Changes

*   **Authentication:** All new endpoints are protected with an admin API key (`X-API-Key` header).
*   **Input Validation:** Pydantic models are used for request and response validation.
*   **Error Handling:** Safe error handling is implemented for all new endpoints.
*   **OpenAPI Specification:** The OpenAPI spec has been updated to include all new endpoints, schemas, and security requirements.
*   **Testing:** A new suite of unit tests has been added to cover all new endpoints.
*   **Documentation:** The `CHANGELOG.md`, `zotify-api-manual.md`, `full_api_reference.md`, `developer_guide.md`, `roadmap.md`, and `LLD_18step_plan_Zotify_API.md` have been updated to reflect the new features.
