# Task Completion Report: Phase 5 Final Cleanup and Verification

**Date:** 2025-08-09
**Author:** Jules
**Version:** v0.1.35

---

## 1. Summary of Work Completed

This task represents the final cleanup and verification of the Phase 5 endpoint implementation. The last remaining stubbed endpoint, `sync_playlists`, was implemented, and the final direct `httpx` call in the `auth` routes was refactored into the `SpotiClient`. All code is now aligned with the project's architecture, and all tests are passing.

## 2. Key Changes and Implementations

### a. Final Endpoint Implementations

- **`POST /api/spotify/sync_playlists`**: This endpoint is now fully functional. It fetches all of a user's playlists from Spotify (handling pagination) and saves them to a local JSON file for processing.
- **`POST /auth/spotify/callback`**: This endpoint was refactored to use a new `SpotiClient.exchange_code_for_token` method, removing the last piece of direct `httpx` logic from the route files and ensuring all Spotify API communication is centralized in the client.

### b. Testing

- **New Unit Tests:** Unit tests were added for the new `SpotiClient` methods (`get_all_current_user_playlists`, `exchange_code_for_token`).
- **New Integration Tests:** Integration tests were added for the `sync_playlists` endpoint and the refactored `spotify_callback` endpoint.
- **Test Suite Health:** After fixing several test implementation bugs and import errors discovered during the process, the entire test suite of 149 tests is now passing, indicating a high degree of stability.

## 3. Final Documentation Sweep

A full review of all `.md` files (excluding `zotify/`) was performed as per the project's `task_checklist.md`.

### a. Files with Changes

- **`api/docs/CHANGELOG.md`**: Added entry for `v0.1.35` detailing the final changes.
