## 1. Summary of Work Completed

This task marks a major milestone in the completion of Phase 5. All remaining stubbed endpoints related to Spotify playlist management have been fully implemented, tested, and documented. This work completes the core functionality of the Zotify API's interaction with Spotify playlists.

## 2. Key Changes and Implementations

### a. `SpotiClient` Enhancements

The `SpotiClient` was significantly enhanced with a full suite of methods for playlist management:
- `get_current_user_playlists`
- `get_playlist`
- `get_playlist_tracks`
- `create_playlist`
- `update_playlist_details`
- `add_tracks_to_playlist`
- `remove_tracks_from_playlist`
- `unfollow_playlist`

### b. Service and Route Layer Implementation

- **Service Layer:** Corresponding service functions were added to `api/src/zotify_api/services/spotify.py` to call the new `SpotiClient` methods.
- **Route Handlers:** All `501 Not Implemented` stubs under `/api/spotify/playlists/` were replaced with fully functional route handlers. This includes endpoints for listing, creating, getting, updating, and deleting playlists, as well as managing their tracks.
- **Schemas:** New Pydantic schemas (`Playlist`, `PlaylistTracks`, `CreatePlaylistRequest`, etc.) were added to ensure proper request and response validation.

### c. Testing

- **Unit Tests:** A comprehensive set of unit tests was added for all new `SpotiClient` playlist methods.
- **Integration Tests:** New integration tests were added for every new playlist endpoint to ensure they function correctly from the API consumer's perspective.
- **Test Health:** All 147 tests in the suite are passing.

## 3. Documentation Sweep

A full review of all `.md` files (excluding `zotify/`) was performed as per the project's updated `task_checklist.md`.
