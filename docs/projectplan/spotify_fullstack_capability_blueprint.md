## 4. Planned API Feature List (with Use Cases)

### Feature: Advanced Search & Metadata Proxy

*   **Description**: Provide a unified search endpoint that proxies Spotify's search capabilities and enriches results with Zotify-specific data (e.g., download availability). Expose direct metadata lookups for all Spotify object types.
*   **Target User Type**: Developer, End-user
*   **APIs Involved**: Spotify Web API, Zotify Internal
*   **Concrete Use Cases**:
    *   A mobile client uses `/search?q=...` to find a track and immediately see if it's available for download.
    *   A script uses `/spotify/tracks/{id}` to fetch official metadata for a locally stored file.
    *   An admin tool queries `/spotify/artists/{id}/albums` to check for new releases from a specific artist.

### Feature: Comprehensive Library Management

*   **Description**: Allow full two-way synchronization of a user's Spotify library, including saved tracks, albums, playlists, and followed artists.
*   **Target User Type**: End-user, Developer
*   **APIs Involved**: Spotify Web API, Zotify Internal
*   **Concrete Use Cases**:
    *   An end-user clicks a "Sync Library" button in the Zotify UI, which calls `POST /user/sync` to pull all their latest liked songs from Spotify.
    *   A developer builds a tool that automatically adds any track downloaded via Zotify to the user's Spotify library by calling `PUT /user/library/tracks`.
    *   A user can manage their playlists directly through Zotify's API, with changes reflected back to Spotify.

### Feature: Librespot-Powered Download Control

*   **Description**: Expose fine-grained control over the Librespot download queue. Allow programmatic starting, stopping, and monitoring of track/album/playlist downloads.
*   **Target User Type**: Developer, Admin
*   **APIs Involved**: Librespot, Zotify Internal
*   **Concrete Use Cases**:
    *   A developer creates a "download manager" UI that shows real-time progress of downloads via a WebSocket connection.
    *   An admin script queues up a large batch of playlists for download by hitting `POST /downloads` with a list of Spotify URIs.
    *   A user can set download quality and format preferences via `PUT /downloads/config`.

### Feature: Real-time Player & Device Emulation

*   **Description**: Expose Librespot's Spotify Connect capabilities, allowing Zotify to appear as a valid playback device and receive commands from the official Spotify app. Provide endpoints to control this virtual player.
*   **Target User Type**: End-user, Developer
*   **APIs Involved**: Librespot, Zotify Internal (potentially WebSockets)
*   **Concrete Use Cases**:
    *   An end-user opens their Spotify app, selects "Zotify" from the device list, and hits play. Zotify begins downloading the track.
    *   A developer builds a custom hardware device (e.g., a smart speaker) that uses the Zotify API to become a Spotify Connect target.
    *   A script can pause or resume the virtual player by calling `PUT /librespot/player/pause`.

### Feature: Webhook & Notification System

*   **Description**: Allow developers to subscribe to events within the Zotify ecosystem, such as download completion, metadata changes, or player state changes.
*   **Target User Type**: Developer
*   **APIs Involved**: Zotify Internal
*   **Concrete Use Cases**:
    *   A developer registers a webhook at `POST /webhooks` to receive a notification whenever a download finishes.
    *   A media server application (like Plex) listens for "track downloaded" events to trigger a library scan.
    *   A user receives a push notification on their phone when a new episode of a followed podcast is downloaded.

---

## 5. Creative Use Case Inventory

*   **Automated Music Archiving**: A script runs nightly, checks the user's "Liked Songs" and "Discover Weekly" playlists, and automatically downloads any new tracks that haven't been downloaded before.
*   **YouTube-to-Spotify Playlist Conversion**: A tool that accepts a YouTube playlist URL, uses a third-party service to identify the tracks, finds them on Spotify using the `/search` endpoint, creates a new Spotify playlist via `POST /users/{user_id}/playlists`, and then queues it for download in Zotify.
*   **Smart Playlist Generator**: A service that creates a new playlist daily by combining the user's top 10 tracks from the last month (`GET /me/top/tracks`) with 10 recommended tracks based on those seeds (`GET /recommendations`).
*   **Plex/Jellyfin Integration**: A companion service that listens for "download complete" webhooks from Zotify and then uses the Plex/Jellyfin APIs to trigger a library scan, ensuring new music is available immediately.
*   **Public Metadata API**: A self-hosted instance of Zotify could expose a public, read-only API for track/album metadata, allowing developers to build music-related websites or bots without requiring their own Spotify API keys.
*   **Advanced Download Rules**: A UI that allows users to set up complex download rules, such as "Download any song by Artist X, but only if the album has a rating of 4 stars or higher on Metacritic," which would involve Zotify calling external APIs for enrichment.
*   **Collaborative Playlist Queue**: A web app that uses WebSockets to allow multiple users to vote on which track should be added to a shared Spotify Connect queue next, using `POST /me/player/queue`.
*   **Multi-format Playlist Exporters**: A tool to export a user's playlists into various formats like M3U, JSON, or XML for compatibility with other music players or for backup purposes.
*   **Personal Listening Analytics**: A dashboard that consumes a user's listening history (`GET /me/player/recently-played`) and top tracks/artists to generate personalized analytics and charts about their listening habits over time.
*   **Discord Music Bot**: A Discord bot that uses Zotify's API to search for and download tracks, then stream them into a voice channel, effectively creating a self-hosted music bot that isn't reliant on YouTube.

## 6. API Design Guidelines

*   **Namespacing**: To maintain clarity and avoid conflicts, the API will be namespaced as follows:
    *   `/spotify/...`: For endpoints that are direct proxies of the Spotify Web API. These should mirror the official Spotify endpoint structure where possible.
    *   `/librespot/...`: For endpoints that expose raw or direct Librespot functionality, such as player control or device emulation.
    *   `/zotify/...` or `/...`: For Zotify's own composite features, such as search, downloads, and library management.

*   **Authentication Strategy**:
    *   **Spotify OAuth**: Endpoints under `/spotify/` and those requiring user-specific actions (e.g., managing playlists, accessing user library) will be protected by a standard Spotify OAuth 2.0 flow. Zotify will manage token acquisition and refresh on behalf of the user.
    *   **Internal API Keys**: For admin-level actions or services that don't have a user context (e.g., system monitoring, managing all downloads), a separate internal API key system will be used. These keys will be configurable by the Zotify administrator.

*   **REST vs. WebSocket**:
    *   **REST**: The majority of the API will be RESTful, using standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for predictable, stateless interactions. This is suitable for metadata lookups, searching, and one-off actions like queueing a download.
    *   **WebSockets**: For real-time features, a WebSocket endpoint (`/ws`) will be provided. Clients can connect to this to receive live updates on download progress, player status changes, and notifications. This avoids the need for constant polling.

*   **Streaming Endpoint Structure**:
    *   Direct audio streaming will not be a primary goal initially.
    *   The `/downloads` endpoint will accept a request to begin a download and return a task ID.
    *   Clients can then either poll a `/downloads/{task_id}/status` endpoint or listen for updates on the WebSocket connection to monitor progress.

*   **Token Refresh Logic**:
    *   Zotify's backend will be responsible for securely storing the user's Spotify refresh token.
    *   It will automatically refresh the access token when it expires and handle any errors related to token expiration gracefully, without requiring user intervention.
    *   The API will expose an endpoint (`/auth/status`) for clients to check the validity of the current user's authentication.

*   **Caching and Rate Limiting**:
    *   **Caching**: Zotify will implement a caching layer (e.g., using Redis) for responses from the Spotify API to reduce redundant calls and improve performance. Metadata that changes infrequently (e.g., track details) will be cached more aggressively than data that changes often (e.g., playlists).
    *   **Rate Limiting**: To prevent abuse and stay within Spotify's API limits, Zotify will implement its own rate limiting on a per-user and/or per-IP basis for all external-facing endpoints.
