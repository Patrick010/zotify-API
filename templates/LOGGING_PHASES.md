# <FEATURE_NAME> System – Phased Implementation

> **Purpose of this Document**
> This file is the **authoritative tracker** for the <FEATURE_NAME> System.
> It defines each phase, current status, deliverables, and governance rules.
>
> **How to Maintain**
> - Update the status markers (`In Progress`, `TODO`, `Done`) as work progresses.
> - Add links to design docs, code directories, or reports under each phase.
> - Keep this document in sync with:
>   - `project/ROADMAP.md` (high-level timeline/phase overview).
>   - `project/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` (requirement-to-phase mapping).
> - Do not remove phases, even if deferred — mark them as *Deferred* or *Obsolete*.
>
> This file ensures that development on this feature is transparent, traceable, and never “lost in the cracks.”

This document tracks the phased design and implementation of the new <FEATURE_NAME> System.
All phases are aligned with the project’s roadmap and traceability requirements.

## Phase Details

### Phase 1 – Core Service *([Status])*
- Build the central `Service` component.
- Provide an async, thread-safe processing pipeline.
- Implement a modular structure for sinks (e.g., file, console, webhook).
- Define configurable levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL).

### Phase 2 – Developer API *([Status])*
- Expose an API for structured interaction.
- Enable per-function/module control over behavior.
- Use an external configuration file (e.g., YAML-based).
- Allow for configuration reloads without a full application restart.

### Phase 3 – Configurable Destinations & Multi-Sink Expansion *([Status])*
- Add additional sink types (e.g., Syslog, Database, Message Queue).
- Allow per-module sink assignment.
- Implement rotation & retention policies for sinks that require them.

### Phase 4 – Runtime Triggers & Actions *([Status])*
- Implement configurable event triggers.
- Allow for multiple trigger actions (e.g., alert, escalate, suppress).
- Support hot-reloading of triggers.
- Support chained triggers.

### Phase 5 – Observability Integration *([Status])*
- Add OpenTelemetry exporters.
- Expose Prometheus metrics.
- Generate structured JSON logs for log aggregators (e.g., ELK/EFK stack).
- Implement correlation/trace IDs.

### Phase 6 – Security & Compliance Layer *([Status])*
- Provide a structured, immutable audit stream.
- Automatically redact secrets and sensitive data.
- Allow for classification of events (e.g., normal, audit, security).
- Align with relevant compliance standards (e.g., GDPR).

### Phase 7 – Developer Extensibility Framework *([Status])*
- Define a clear adapter/plugin API.
- Provide example adapters (e.g., for Slack, Discord, custom webhooks).
- Write developer documentation for creating custom extensions.

### Phase 8 – Full Observability Suite *([Status], Long-Term)*
- Create a centralized dashboard for visualization.
- Implement real-time log subscriptions (e.g., via WebSockets/SSE).
- Research anomaly detection or AI-assisted insights.
