**NOTE: This is a mandatory pre-submit checklist. All applicable steps must be verified before your work is considered complete.**

---

### A. For ALL Changes (including documentation)

#### 1. Task Qualification
- [ ] **Task Readiness Verification:** Manually confirm the task conforms to the template in `<link_to_backlog_file>` and meets all readiness criteria in `<link_to_pid_file>` before starting work.

#### 2. Documentation — Mandatory & Verifiable
- [ ] **Trinity Update**: Ensure the project's source of truth (the "Trinity": `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `ACTIVITY.md`, and `SESSION_LOG.md`) is fully updated to reflect the current state before committing.
- [ ] Have all relevant documentation files, identified by consulting the `<link_to_project_registry>`, been updated to reflect the changes made?
- [ ] Have the changes been cross-referenced in the `<link_to_traceability_matrix>` or other relevant tracking documents?
- [ ] Does the commit message clearly explain the "what" and the "why"?
- [ ] **HLD & LLD**: Update or create high-level and low-level design docs if implementation deviates from specs. Include clear architectural change summaries.
- [ ] **Roadmap**: Update the project roadmap if timelines, scope, or priorities change.
- [ ] **User & Operator Guides**: Update developer, operator, and user guides for all functional changes, including API examples.
- [ ] **CHANGELOG**: Add entries reflecting **all** functional changes: new/modified/removed endpoints, param changes, behavioral changes.
- [ ] For traceability, all documentation changes must be included in the same commit as the code changes they relate to.

#### 3. Process & Workflow
- [ ] Include **explicit approval steps** (code reviews, security/privacy sign-offs) if your project workflow requires them.
- [ ] Follow a **clear branching and release process**.

### B. ONLY If Code Was Modified

#### 1. Security
- [ ] Review code changes for **security risks**: injection, data leaks, improper authentication, unsafe file handling.
- [ ] Ensure **API key handling** complies with the project's established security policies.
- [ ] Confirm **least-privilege principle** is applied for endpoints, data access, and dependencies.
- [ ] Add or update the `<link_to_security_document>` with any new security considerations.
- [ ] Verify any new dependencies or third-party components are vetted for security and properly licensed.

#### 2. Privacy
- [ ] Review code changes for **privacy compliance** (GDPR, CCPA, or other applicable regulations).
- [ ] Confirm sensitive data is **minimized**, **encrypted** where needed, and **never logged in plain text**.
- [ ] Update the `<link_to_privacy_compliance_document>` reflecting new privacy impacts and controls.
- [ ] Enforce user data rights: consent capture, data export, deletion, correction, and withdrawal mechanisms.
- [ ] Extend audit logging to track all personal data access and changes securely.
- [ ] Integrate privacy by design and default into the task's implementation.

#### 3. Code Quality
- [ ] Follow established **naming conventions**, directory structures, and coding style guides strictly.
- [ ] Maintain strict **modularity** — separate concerns cleanly, avoid cross-layer leakage.
- [ ] Ensure complete and correct **type hints** and **docstrings** for all functions, classes, and modules.
- [ ] Perform **code reviews** with a focus on readability, maintainability, performance, and security.
- [ ] Consider efficiency, scalability, and resource usage when writing or modifying code.
- [ ] Refactor legacy or autogenerated code as needed to meet quality standards.

#### 4. Tests
- [ ] Have the relevant unit or integration tests been run and confirmed to pass?
- [ ] Have new tests been added to cover the changes?
- [ ] For security- or privacy-sensitive features, write **negative tests** simulating invalid inputs, unauthorized access, or malformed data.
