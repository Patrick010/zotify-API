# High-Level Design (HLD) – <PROJECT_NAME>

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Purpose
This document outlines the high-level architecture, scope, and guiding principles for the <PROJECT_NAME>. It serves as a blueprint for the development team to maintain alignment with long-term goals.

## 2. Scope
The project aims to:
- Transition all subsystems to a **dedicated service layer** architecture.
- Improve **testability**, **maintainability**, and **separation of concerns**.
- Establish a **living documentation** workflow where all documentation is kept in constant alignment with the codebase.

## 3. Architecture Overview
**Key Layers:**
1. **Routes Layer** — e.g., FastAPI route handlers; minimal logic.
2. **Service Layer** — Pure business logic; no framework dependencies.
3. **Schema Layer** — e.g., Pydantic models for validation and serialization.
4. **Persistence Layer** — A unified, backend-agnostic database system (e.g., built on SQLAlchemy).
5. **Provider Abstraction Layer** — An interface that decouples the core application from specific service providers. The long-term vision may be to supersede this with a dynamic plugin system, as detailed in a proposal document.
6. **Config Layer** — Centralized settings with environment-based overrides.
7. **Generic Error Handling Layer** — A centralized, platform-wide module for catching, processing, and responding to all exceptions.
8. **Logging Layer** — A centralized, extendable service for handling all application logging, including system, audit, and job status logs.
9. **Authentication Provider Interface** — An extension of the Provider Abstraction Layer that standardizes how authentication flows (e.g., OAuth2) are initiated and handled.

**Data Flow Example (Generic Request):**
1. Request hits the Routes Layer.
2. Route validates input with a schema from the Schema Layer.
3. Route calls a method in the Service Layer (e.g., using dependency injection).
4. Service queries the Persistence Layer or an external API via a Provider.
5. Response is returned to the client, serialized by the Schema Layer.

### 3.1 Supporting Modules

The <PLATFORM_NAME> can include supporting modules that are not part of the Core API but are essential to the ecosystem.

-   **<Test_UI_Module>:** A standalone developer testing UI. It can provide a web-based interface for interacting with all API endpoints and might include an embedded database browser.
-   **<Helper_Module>:** A helper application for managing complex flows, such as OAuth callbacks for CLI-based clients.

### 3.2 Generic Error Handling

To ensure platform-wide stability and consistent behavior, the system implements a centralized error handling module.

**Key Principles:**
-   **Global Interception:** The module hooks into the web framework's middleware and the main application event loop to provide global coverage.
-   **Standardized Responses:** It formats all errors into a consistent, predictable schema (e.g., JSON for an API), preventing inconsistent or leaky error messages.
-   **Configurable Automation:** It can feature a trigger/action system to perform automated actions (e.g., send alerts, retry operations) in response to specific, predefined error types.

### 3.3 Flexible Logging Framework

To ensure consistent and comprehensive observability, the platform can implement a developer-facing, flexible logging framework.

**Key Principles:**
- **Developer-Centric API:** Provides a simple function that allows developers to control logging behavior (level, destination, metadata) on a per-call basis.
- **Tag-Based Routing:** Uses a tag-based system to decouple the logging of an event from its handling.
- **Configuration-Driven Sinks:** Logging destinations ("sinks") are defined in an external configuration file (e.g., a YAML file).
- **Security by Default:** Can automatically redact sensitive data (like tokens and API keys) from all log messages in production environments.
- **Runtime Flexibility:** The logging configuration can be reloaded at runtime via an API endpoint without a restart.
- **Asynchronous by Design:** Log processing is handled asynchronously to minimize performance impact.
- **Extensibility via Plugins:** Can be designed to be extensible, allowing developers to create custom sink types.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Test Coverage**: e.g., >90% unit test coverage.
- **Performance**: e.g., <200ms average API response time for common queries.
- **Security**: Authentication for sensitive endpoints; input validation on all routes.
- **Extensibility**: Minimal coupling; future modules should plug into the service layer.

## 5. Documentation Governance

The project can adopt a "living documentation" approach:

- **Reality First**: The codebase is treated as the ground truth. Documentation is updated to reflect the actual, verified behavior of the application.
- **Continuous Alignment**: All significant changes to code must be accompanied by corresponding updates to all relevant documentation in the same commit.
- **Centralized Logging**: All work should be logged in official project logs (e.g., `ACTIVITY.md`) to maintain a clear, traceable history.
- **Mandatory Verification**: When new documents are created, they must be integrated into the existing documentation hierarchy (e.g., linked in `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`).

## 6. Deployment Model
- **Dev**: e.g., Local Docker + SQLite
- **Prod**: e.g., Containerized app with Postgres and optional Redis
- **CI/CD**: e.g., GitHub Actions with linting, tests, and build pipelines.

## 7. Security Model
- e.g., OAuth2 for external service integration.
- e.g., JWT for internal API authentication.
- Principle of least privilege for database access.
- **CORS Policy:** Implement a configurable CORS policy to allow web-based UIs to interact with the API.

> Note: Specific, long-term security ambitions should be tracked in a `FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md` document.

## 8. Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Drift between documentation and code.
  **Mitigation**: A mandatory PR checklist and/or CI step that flags documentation inconsistencies.
- **Risk**: A large refactor introduces regressions.
  **Mitigation**: An incremental, step-by-step plan with passing tests at each stage.

## 9. Security

A comprehensive overview of the security architecture should be available in a dedicated `SECURITY.md` document.

## 10. Future Vision

While this document outlines the current architecture, the project should maintain a separate `FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md` document to capture the long-term product vision.
