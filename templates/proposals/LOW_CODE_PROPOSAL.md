# Proposal: <Title of Proposal, e.g., "Dynamic Plugin System">

**Date:** <DATE>
**Author:** <TEAM_MEMBER>
**Status:** Proposed

## 1. Problem Statement

[Provide a clear description of the problem or opportunity. What is the current state, and what are its limitations? Why is a change needed? For example: "The current framework is highly configurable but not easily extensible. Adding a new *type* of component requires direct modification of the core codebase."]

## 2. Proposed Solution

[Describe the proposed solution at a high level. For example: "This document proposes the implementation of a **dynamic plugin system** for the <FEATURE_NAME>, based on a standard packaging metadata system like Python's `entry_points`."]

### 2.1. How It Will Work

1.  **Defining the Plugin Interface:** The application will define a specific entry point (e.g., `<project_name>.plugins.sinks`). This serves as a public contract for any potential plugin.
2.  **Creating a Plugin:** A developer creates a new, separate package. In their package's configuration (e.g., `pyproject.toml`), they register their custom class against the application's entry point.
    ```toml
    [project.entry-points."<project_name>.plugins.sinks"]
    my_sink = "my_plugin_package.main:MySinkClass"
    ```
3.  **Plugin Discovery:** The application's `PluginService` will be modified to scan the environment for all installed packages that have registered a plugin for the defined entry point.
4.  **Plugin Instantiation:** The `PluginService` will add these discovered plugins to its list of available types. When it encounters a sink of a custom type in its configuration, it will know how to load and instantiate the class from the plugin package.

## 3. Benefits

-   **True Extensibility:** Developers can add entirely new capabilities without ever touching the core application code.
-   **Decoupling:** The core application does not need to know about any specific plugin implementation.
-   **Future-Proofing:** This makes the framework adaptable to any future technology.

## 4. High-Level Implementation Plan

1.  **Modify Core Service:** Add a discovery mechanism using the packaging metadata library.
2.  **Define a Clear Plugin Interface:** Ensure the base class for plugins is well-documented and stable.
3.  **Update Documentation:** Create a new developer guide for creating plugins.
4.  **Create a Reference Implementation:** To validate the system, create a simple example plugin.

## 5. Security Considerations

[Describe the security considerations of the proposed solution. For a plugin system, this is critical.]

### 5.1. The Core Risk
[Describe the main risk, e.g., "Any package installed in the same environment can register itself as a plugin, potentially executing malicious code."]

### 5.2. Mitigation Strategy
[Describe the mitigation strategy.]
1.  **Administrator Responsibility:** The primary mitigation is operational security. Administrators must be instructed to only install trusted, vetted plugins.
2.  **Safe Loading in Code:** The plugin loading mechanism must be wrapped in a `try...except` block to prevent a faulty plugin from crashing the entire application.
3.  **Future Enhancement (e.g., Plugin Signing):** A more advanced solution could involve cryptographic signing of trusted plugins.

## 6. Architectural Impact

[Describe the long-term architectural impact of this proposal.]

### 6.1. Superseding an Existing Layer
[For example: "The plugin system described here is the natural evolution and intended replacement for the current `Provider Abstraction Layer`."]

## 7. Future Possibilities

[Describe other areas of the application where this new architectural pattern could be applied.]
