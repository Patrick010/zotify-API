# Future Enhancements & Product Vision

> **Note:** See the [`TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`](./TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md) for status and implementation tracking of these enhancements.

**Date:** <DATE>
**Status:** Living Document

## 1. Purpose

This document serves as a dedicated "parking lot" for new ambitions and feature ideas that have emerged during development but are not part of the current, committed roadmap. It is meant to capture long-term vision without disrupting the alignment and verification process of the active development phases.

## 2. Planned Technical Enhancements

This section lists specific technical features and improvements that are candidates for future development phases.

*   **Advanced Admin Endpoint Security:**
    *   Transition from a static admin API key to a more robust, layered security model, including rate limiting, JWT/OAuth2 for user-level endpoints, and dynamic key rotation.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    *   Implement a full RBAC system to support multi-user environments with different permission levels. This is a prerequisite for any significant multi-user functionality.
*   **Persistent & Distributed Job Queue:**
    *   Replace the current in-memory download queue with a persistent, database or Redis-backed system to ensure job durability across restarts and to support distributed workers.
*   **Full <Service Provider> Integration & Library Sync:**
    *   Expand an integration with a key service provider to include full, two-way synchronization (write-sync).
    *   Implement full library management, including the ability to read and modify a user's saved items.
*   **Enhanced Download & Job Management:**
    *   Implement detailed, real-time progress reporting for background jobs.
    *   Introduce user notifications for job completion or failure.
    *   Develop sophisticated retry policies with exponential backoff and error classification.
*   **API Governance:**
    *   Implement API rate limiting and usage quotas per user or API key to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse.
*   **Observability:**
    *   Improve the audit trail with more detailed event logging.
    *   Add real-time monitoring hooks for integration with external monitoring systems.
*   **<Helper Module> Enhancement:**
    *   Investigate the further development of a conceptual helper module or tool.
    *   Potential enhancements include running it as a persistent background service, developing it into a browser plugin for seamless integration, or expanding it to handle multi-service authentication flows.
*   **Dynamic Plugin System:**
    *   Implement a dynamic plugin system (e.g., based on Python's `entry_points`) to allow third-party developers to create and install their own custom components without modifying the core API code. See the full proposal at `<link to proposal>`.
*   **Home Automation Integration:**
    *   Develop a dedicated integration for home automation platforms (e.g., Home Assistant). This could expose the service as a `media_player` entity and provide services for triggering actions from within home automations. See the full proposal at `<link to proposal>`.

## 3. API Adoption & Usability Philosophy

Beyond technical features, the long-term success of the API depends on making it irresistibly easy and valuable for developers to adopt. The following principles will guide future development.

### 3.1. Crazy Simple Usage
*   **Goal:** Minimize setup and authentication friction. Ensure the API works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Provide ready-made SDKs or client libraries for popular languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Go).
    *   Develop a collection of example apps, recipes, and templates for common use cases.
    *   Maintain a clear, concise, and consistent API design and error handling schema.

### 3.2. Feature-Rich Beyond a Standard API
*   **Goal:** Provide capabilities that a standard API for a given service lacks, making our API more powerful for specific use cases.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Build out advanced background job management features (progress, retry, queue control).
    *   Support bulk operations for efficient management of data.
    *   Integrate caching and local state synchronization to improve performance and resilience.

### 3.3. Competitive Differentiators
*   **Goal:** Focus on features that make our API stand out in terms of reliability, security, and performance.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Transparency:** Provide clear audit logs and job state visibility.
    *   **Security:** Start with strong security defaults and provide a clear roadmap to advanced, layered authentication.
    *   **Performance:** Offer background processing for long-running tasks and intelligent rate limits.
    *   **Extensibility:** Design for extensibility with features like webhooks and a plugin system.

### 3.4. Pragmatic Documentation & Support
*   **Goal:** Create documentation that is practical, example-driven, and helps developers solve real-world problems quickly.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Focus on "how-to" guides and tutorials over purely theoretical references.
    *   Establish a developer community channel (e.g., Discord, forum) for feedback, support, and collaboration.

### 3.5. Low-Code / No-Code Platform Integration

*   **Goal:** To make the API's power accessible to non-programmers and citizen developers through visual, flow-based programming environments.
*   **Vision:** While a plugin system extends the API's backend, integration with platforms like Node-RED or Zapier would extend its reach. This would involve creating a dedicated package of nodes or modules for that platform.
*   **Synergy:** These nodes would act as well-designed clients for the API. The more powerful the backend API becomes (through plugins), the more powerful these visual building blocks become. This creates a synergistic ecosystem for both developers and power users. See the full proposal at `<link to proposal>`.

## 4. General Architectural Principles

### Unified Database Layer
- Expand the unified database layer to support multi-service integrations and provider-specific data.
- Implement advanced querying, caching, and transactional features.
- Ensure smooth migration paths for any additional persistence needs.
- Maintain strict separation between API logic and data storage for flexibility.

### Unified Provider Abstraction Layer
- Define a core, normalized set of API endpoints and data models that cover common operations across providers.
- Implement lightweight translation matrices or connector modules to handle provider-specific API differences.
- Support pluggable authentication and token management per provider.
- Ensure extensibility for easy addition of new service providers.
