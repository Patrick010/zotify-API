# Gap Analysis ‚Äì <PROJECT_NAME> vs. User Use Cases

This document compares the **desired capabilities** from `USECASES.md` with the **current** API implementation.
The goal is to identify missing or partial functionality that must be addressed to meet user expectations.

---

## Legend
- ‚úÖ **Supported** ‚Äì Feature is already implemented and functional.
- üü° **Partial** ‚Äì Some capability exists, but not full requirements.
- ‚ùå **Missing** ‚Äì No current implementation.
- üîç **Needs Verification** ‚Äì Unclear if current implementation covers this.

---

## 1. Merge and Sync Local + Remote Data (Example)
**Status:** ‚ùå Missing
**Gaps:**
- No current ability to read local data files (e.g., `.m3u`, `.csv`).
- No deduplication logic across different data sources.
- No functionality to create or update remote resources from merged data.
- No functionality to export merged data to a local file.

---

## 2. Remote Resource Rebuild Based on Filters (Example)
**Status:** ‚ùå Missing
**Gaps:**
- No item filtering based on metadata (e.g., duration, creation date).
- No integration with the remote service's recommendation engine.
- No overwrite or "save-as-new" functionality for remote resources.

---

## 3. Smart Auto-Download and Sync (Example)
**Status:** üü° Partial
**Existing:**
- Can manually trigger a download of a remote resource.
**Gaps:**
- No automatic change detection for remote resources.
- No automated download/delete workflow to keep local and remote in sync.
- No local filename or metadata normalization step.

---

## 4. Multi-Format, Multi-Quality Processing (Example)
**Status:** üü° Partial
**Existing:**
- Basic conversion to a single format (e.g., MP3) is supported.
**Gaps:**
- No support for multiple simultaneous format outputs.
- No support for high-quality or lossless formats (e.g., FLAC, ALAC).
- No ability to organize outputs into separate directories per format.

---

## Summary of Gaps
- **Data Handling:** [e.g., Local file integration, merging, filtering, metadata editing, versioning, sync automation.]
- **Advanced Processing:** [e.g., Multi-format, high-quality/lossless, alternate codecs, fine-grained control, size constraints.]
- **Automation & Intelligence:** [e.g., Change detection, quality upgrades, recommendation-based rebuilds.]
- **Service Integration Depth:** [e.g., Uploading local data, resource creation and overwriting, historical rollback.]

**Overall Coverage Estimate:** [<XX>% of desired functionality currently exists in partial form.]

---

## Recommendations
1. **Phase Next:** [e.g., Implement core data handling capabilities (local read/write, remote write, merge/dedup) as these unlock multiple use cases.]
2. [e.g., Add advanced processing framework upgrades to handle multi-format, advanced parameters, and alternate codecs.]
3. [e.g., Expand automation layer to include change detection and quality upgrade triggers.]
