# Execution Plan

**Status:** Live Document

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the tasks required to fulfill the [Canonical Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md).

## Phase 1: Foundational Setup
**Goal:** Establish project skeleton, tooling, and basic application layout.
**Status:** [‚úÖ Done | üü° In Progress | ‚ùå Not Started]
**Steps:**
- [ ] Set up repository structure and version control.
- [ ] Configure CI pipelines (e.g., for linting, testing, security scans).
- [ ] Implement environment handling (e.g., `.env` files for dev/prod modes).
- [ ] Build the basic application skeleton with a modular folder structure.
- [ ] Establish basic build scripts and documentation references.

## Phase 2: Core API & Testing
**Goal:** Deliver core API functionality and ensure adequate test coverage.
**Status:** [‚úÖ Done | üü° In Progress | ‚ùå Not Started]
**Steps:**
- [ ] Implement core endpoints for primary resources (e.g., users, items, metadata).
- [ ] Add notification endpoints and ensure proper response models.
- [ ] Wire up the test suite with example test cases covering the core API.
- [ ] Integrate documentation and API specs (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger).
- [ ] Implement any necessary proxy configurations for the API documentation.
- [ ] Stub initial user system wiring (e.g., authentication placeholders).
- [ ] Achieve stable CI passes across all configured environments.

## Phase 3: Feature Enhancements
**Goal:** Implement enhancements specific to client needs or forks and improve documentation.
**Status:** [‚úÖ Done | üü° In Progress | ‚ùå Not Started]
**Steps:**
- [ ] Integrate administrative features (e.g., admin keys, audit logging).
- [ ] Add security workflows (e.g., API key revocation and rotation).
- [ ] Split documentation into separate guides (e.g., Developer Guide, Operator Guide).
- [ ] Address compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR data endpoints).

## Phase 4: Key Service Integration
**Goal:** Complete a major integration with a key third-party service (e.g., a specific provider like Spotify, or a payment gateway).
**Status:** [‚úÖ Done | üü° In Progress | ‚ùå Not Started]
**Steps:**
- [ ] Implement library sync endpoints for both read and write operations.
- [ ] Finalize resource management endpoints (e.g., creation, modification, deletion).
- [ ] Build webhook support for event-driven updates.
- [ ] Expand CI to include code coverage tracking.
- [ ] Prepare DevOps templates (e.g., GitHub workflows, issue templates).

## [Add More Phases as Needed]
```

I've made a small correction to my plan in the last phase name. I will now create the file.I've reviewed `project/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`. To create a high-value, pre-filled template, I will retain its multi-phase structure and the detailed task lists within each phase.

My approach will be to:
1.  Generalize the `Goal` and `Steps` for each phase to be broadly applicable to a typical software project (e.g., "Foundational Setup," "Core API & Testing," "Feature Enhancements").
2.  Remove any project-specific details, such as the `JULES-NOTE` comments and the reference to `gonk-testUI`.
3.  Replace the status icons (‚úÖ, üü°, ‚ùå) with a generic status placeholder like `[Status]`.

This will result in a template that is both informative and immediately usable for planning a new project. I will now create the new `templates/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`.
