# Low-Level Design (LLD) â€“ <PROJECT_NAME>

## Purpose
This LLD describes the specific implementation details of the <PROJECT_NAME>'s subsystems, with a focus on its core architecture.

---

## API Middleware

The web application can use several middleware to provide cross-cutting concerns.

*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**:
    *   **Module:** `<path_to_main_app_file>`
    *   **Purpose:** To allow web-based clients (like a test UI) hosted on different origins (IP/port) to communicate with the API. This is a browser security requirement.
    *   **Configuration:** The middleware can be configured to be permissive for local development or more restrictive for a production deployment.

*   **Request ID**:
    *   **Module:** `<path_to_request_id_middleware>`
    *   **Purpose:** Injects a unique ID into every incoming request for improved logging and traceability.

---

## Provider Abstraction Layer

**Goal:** To decouple the core application logic from specific service providers, allowing for future expansion to other services.

**Module:** `<path_to_providers_directory>`

*   **`base.py`**: Defines the `BaseProvider` abstract base class. This class specifies the common interface that all provider connectors must implement (e.g., `search`, `get_item`).
*   **`<service>_connector.py`**: Contains the connector class that implements the `BaseProvider` interface for a specific service. All service-specific logic is encapsulated here.
*   **Dependency (`<path_to_deps_file>`)**: A dependency injector is responsible for instantiating and returning the currently active provider connector.

---

## Unified Database Architecture

**Goal:** To establish a single, unified, and backend-agnostic persistence layer for the entire application, for example, using an ORM like SQLAlchemy.

**Module:** `<path_to_database_directory>`

*   **`session.py`**: Creates a single database `engine` based on the `DATABASE_URI` from the application settings and provides a factory for creating database sessions.
*   **`models.py`**: Contains all ORM model definitions.
*   **`crud.py`**: Provides a layer of abstraction for all database operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

---

## Configuration Management

The application can use a dual system for managing configuration, separating immutable startup settings from mutable runtime settings.

*   **Startup Configuration (`config.py`)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Manages core, system-level settings required for the application to boot (e.g., `database_uri`, `admin_api_key`).
    *   **Source**: Settings are loaded from environment variables (e.g., using `pydantic-settings`).
    *   **Mutability**: These settings are considered immutable and are only read once at startup.

*   **Application Configuration (`config_service.py`)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Manages user-facing application settings that can be changed during operation (e.g., `scan_interval`, `notification_settings`).
    *   **Source**: Settings are persisted in a database table or a JSON file.
    *   **Mutability**: These settings can be read and updated at runtime via API endpoints.

---

## Generic Error Handling Module

**Goal:** To centralize all exception handling in a single, configurable, and extensible module.

**Module:** `<path_to_error_handler_directory>`

*   **`main.py` or `__init__.py`**: Contains the core `ErrorHandler` class for processing exceptions.
*   **`hooks.py`**: Contains functions for integrating the `ErrorHandler` with the rest of the system (e.g., web framework middleware, `sys.excepthook`).
*   **`config.py`**: Defines the models for the error handler's configuration (e.g., a YAML file).
*   **`triggers.py`**: Implements the logic for a trigger/action system (e.g., on a certain error, send a webhook).
*   **`formatter.py`**: Contains different formatter classes for standardizing the error output (e.g., `JsonFormatter`, `PlainTextFormatter`).

---

## Flexible Logging Framework

**Goal:** To provide a developer-centric, configurable, and asynchronous logging framework.

**Module:** `<path_to_logging_framework_directory>`

*   **`schemas.py`**: Defines the models for validating the logging configuration file.
*   **`service.py`**: Contains the core `LoggingService` that loads the configuration, instantiates sinks, and dispatches log events.
*   **`filters.py`**: Contains any custom logging filters, such as a `SensitiveDataFilter` to redact secrets from logs in production.
*   **Integration:** The framework is initialized on application startup and can be reloaded via a dedicated API endpoint.

---

## Supporting Modules

This section describes the low-level design of official supporting modules for the <PLATFORM_NAME>.

### `<Test_UI_Module>`

**Purpose:** A standalone developer tool for testing the API.

*   **Backend:** A lightweight web server (e.g., Flask).
*   **Frontend:** A single-page application (e.g., built with plain JavaScript). It can dynamically fetch the API's OpenAPI schema to build forms for each endpoint.

### `<Helper_Module>`

**Purpose:** A helper application to securely manage complex flows (e.g., OAuth) for CLI clients.

*   **Architecture:** Can be a self-contained, single-file application (e.g., in Go) that runs a temporary local web server.

## Ongoing Maintenance
All development tasks must follow the [Task Execution Checklist](./task_checklist.md) to ensure consistency, quality, and security.
