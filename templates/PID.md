## 1. Full Business Case

**Justification:**
[Provide the business justification for this project. What is the problem or opportunity? What is the current state, and what are its limitations? This project aims to refactor and expand an existing system to form a robust, scalable, and provider-agnostic backend for automation, integrations, and developer tooling.]

**Strategic Goals:**
- [Transition the project from a single-purpose tool into a fully modular framework capable of integrating with multiple data sources or services.]
- [Lay the foundation for a future-ready architecture that supports automation, analytics, and secure multi-user workflows.]
- [Deliver an API or system that is developer-friendly, self-documented, and scalable without major redesigns.]
- [Enable multiple interaction models, such as a CLI and a WebUI, giving users and developers a choice of interfaces.]

**Business Benefits:**
- **[Benefit 1, e.g., Reduced Operational Risk]:** [Explain the benefit, e.g., A persistent database eliminates data loss.]
- **[Benefit 2, e.g., Faster Development]:** [Explain the benefit, e.g., A cleaner, modular architecture accelerates new feature delivery.]
- **[Benefit 3, e.g., Better Scalability]:** [Explain the benefit, e.g., The system is prepared for higher load and more data.]
- **[Benefit 4, e.g., Future Expansion]:** [Explain the benefit, e.g., A provider-agnostic design allows easy addition of new services.]

## 2. Detailed Project Scope & Product Breakdown

### 2.1 In Scope
- [ ] [Full audit of the codebase against documentation.]
- [ ] [Refactoring to a unified, backend-agnostic persistence layer.]
- [ ] [Migration of all file-based and in-memory data to the new database.]
- [ ] [Creation of a standalone developer testing UI.]
- [ ] [Complete overhaul of system documentation.]
- [ ] [Creation of formal project management documents (e.g., this PID).]

### 2.2 Out of Scope (Current Phase)
- [List any features that are intentionally out of scope for the current phase, but may be considered for the future. For example, advanced security layers or support for additional providers.]

### 2.3 Main Products (Deliverables)
1. **[Refactored Core System (v1.0)]:** [e.g., New database architecture with modular design.]
2. **[Developer Tooling Module (v0.1.0)]:** [e.g., A developer testing tool.]
3. **[System Documentation Set]:** [e.g., Fully updated `docs/system/` directory.]
4. **[Project Management Documentation]:** [e.g., This PID, Project Brief, etc.]
5. **[Helper Scripts]:** [e.g., A unified startup script.]

### 2.4 Deferred Features
Deferred features are tracked in `FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md` until they are promoted to an active roadmap phase.

## 3. Stage Plans (High-Level)

- **Stage 1: Audit & Alignment** — Code/documentation gap analysis and alignment.
- **Stage 2: Core Refactoring** — e.g., Unified database, new dev UI.
- **Stage 3: Documentation & Formalization** — Full system documentation, formal project docs.
- **Stage 4: Provider Abstraction** — Design and implementation of a multi-provider layer.

---

## 4. Project Controls

- **Reporting:** Progress tracked in `ACTIVITY.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md` and `CURRENT_STATE.md`. These 3 files, a.k.a. `Trinity` must always be aligned with codereality
- **Change Control:** All changes require proposal, approval, and re-approval if scope deviates.
- **Handling of Postponed Tasks:** Postponed or paused tasks must be moved from the `ACTIVITY.md` log to the `BACKLOG.md` with an appropriate status.
- **Backlog Management and Task Qualification:** The following process is mandatory for managing the `BACKLOG.md`:
  - **Task Generation:** Each task added to the backlog must reference at least one source item from a live project document (e.g., `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`, `USECASES.md`). All tasks must conform to the template defined in `BACKLOG.md`.
  - **Task Qualification:** A task is only eligible for execution if all of its dependencies are resolved and its acceptance criteria are fully defined.
- **Quality Assurance:**
  - Code reviews before merge.
  - Unit/integration testing.
  - Continuous documentation updates in sync with code changes.
  - **Logging of Changes:** All significant changes must be logged and reflected in all relevant project documentation.
  - **Traceability Matrix Maintenance:** `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` is a live document and must be updated with all requirement changes.
  - **Verification of Documentation Integration:** When new documents are created, they must be correctly integrated and referenced in the `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`.
  - **Structured Logging Mandate:** All new and existing functionality must use the defined logging framework.
  - **Centralized Error Handling Mandate:** All unhandled exceptions must be processed by the Generic Error Handling Module.

## 5. Risk, Issue, and Quality Registers

- **Risk Register:**
  - *Risk:* [Description of a potential risk, e.g., "Development tools are unreliable."]
  - *Impact:* [Describe the potential impact, e.g., "Delays and workarounds reduce efficiency."]
  - *Mitigation:* [Describe the mitigation strategy, e.g., "External code review, safe file operations."]

- **Issue Register:**
  - *Issue #1:* [Description of a known issue.]
  - *Status:* [Open | In Progress | Closed]
  - *Impact:* [Describe the impact.]
  - *Action:* [Describe the action to be taken.]

- **Quality Register:**
  - [All code must be reviewed.]
  - [All docs must be updated with every change.]
  - [Key project state documents (PID, CURRENT_STATE.md, etc.) must remain in sync.]

## 6. Project Organisation (Roles & Responsibilities)

- **Project Board / Project Executive:** <STAKEHOLDER_ROLE> — provides mandate, sets requirements, approves plans.
- **Project Manager:** <STAKEHOLDER_ROLE> — manages flow, gives detailed direction.
- **Senior Supplier / Lead Developer:** <TEAM_MEMBER> — responsible for technical design, implementation, testing, and documentation.

---

## 7. Communication Management Approach

- [Describe the primary method of communication, e.g., "All communication via interactive session."]
- [Describe how progress is reported, e.g., "Regular updates and `CURRENT_STATE.md` hand-offs."]
- [Describe how direction is given, e.g., "User provides approvals and new directives."]

---

## 8. Configuration Management Approach

- **Source Code:** Managed in Git with feature branches.
- **Documentation:** Markdown in repo, versioned alongside code.
- **Project State:** Tracked in living docs (`ACTIVITY.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `PID.md`).

---

## 9. Tailoring Approach

- [Describe how standard project management principles (e.g., PRINCE2, Agile) are adapted for this project's specific workflow.]
