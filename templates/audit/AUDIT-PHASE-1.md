# Audit Phase <Phase_Number>: <Phase_Name>

**Date:** <DATE>
**Author:** <TEAM_MEMBER>
**Objective:** [State the objective of this audit phase, e.g., "To track the execution of tasks defined in the <PLAN_DOCUMENT>.md and to ensure that all quality gates and automation are in place to prevent future design drift."]

### Task: <Task_Name> (Example)

*   **Status:** [‚úÖ Done | üü° In Progress | ‚ùå Blocked]
*   **Summary of Activities:**
    1.  **Blocker Resolution:** The initial blocker, a misconfigured setting in `<config_file>`, was identified and resolved.
    2.  **Code Formatting:** A standard code formatter (e.g., `black`, `prettier`) was run, resolving the majority of style-based issues.
    3.  **Manual Linting:** The remaining errors were fixed manually across multiple files.
    4.  **Test Suite Stabilization:** The test suite was failing due to a database error. This was traced to a missing `<storage_directory>` directory required by the test database. The directory was created, resolving the issue.
    5.  **Scope Cleanup:** An out-of-scope directory was identified and deleted to reduce project noise.
*   **Outcome:** The codebase is now 100% compliant with the linter configuration. The test suite is stable, with all tests passing as expected.

### <DATE>: Design of <New_Feature> (Example)

**Audit Finding:**
A new major feature, the <New_Feature>, was proposed and designed.

**Verification Activities:**
- A new proposal document, `<PROPOSAL_DOCUMENT>.md`, was created.
- The proposal was integrated into the project's living documentation by updating `<FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS_DOC>.md` and `<PROJECT_REGISTRY_DOC>.md`.

**Conclusion:**
The design task is complete. The new proposed architecture is fully documented and tracked in accordance with project standards.

### <DATE>: Post-Verification Hardening (Example)

**Audit Finding:**
Following the initial successful verification of project documentation, a full run of the test suite was initiated as a final quality gate. This uncovered several latent bugs that were not apparent from the documentation or previous test runs.

**Issues Discovered and Resolved:**
1.  **Latent Unit Test Bugs:** A full `pytest` run revealed several failures in `<path_to_test_file>`. These were caused by incorrect mocks, incomplete mock objects, incorrect test assertions, and a logic bug in the service itself. All failing tests were repaired.
2.  **Runtime `TypeError`:** Subsequent manual testing revealed a `TypeError` on an API endpoint. This was traced to an unsafe comparison between a timezone-naive datetime from the database and a timezone-aware `datetime`. A fix was implemented in the relevant service to make the comparison robust.

**Conclusion:**
The discovery and resolution of these issues have significantly hardened the stability and reliability of the codebase.

### <DATE>: Independent Verification by New Developer (Example)

**Audit Task:**
As per the handover brief and onboarding instructions, perform an independent verification of the project's state. The goal is to confirm that the key "source of truth" documents (`CURRENT_STATE.md`, `ACTIVITY.md`, etc.) accurately reflect the state of the codebase.

**Verification Activities & Findings:**
A series of spot-checks were performed against the claims made in the documentation:

1.  **`<Module_Name>` Application Refactoring:**
    *   **Action:** Inspected the `<module>/` directory.
    *   **Finding:** Confirmed that the application was refactored as described in the documentation. **Status: Verified.**

2.  **Logging Framework Hardening:**
    *   **Action:** Inspected `<path_to_logging_config>`.
    *   **Finding:** Confirmed the presence of the `<security_log>` sink and the "security" tag trigger for routing. **Status: Verified.**
    *   **Action:** Inspected `<path_to_log_filter_code>`.
    *   **Finding:** Confirmed the existence and correct redaction logic of the `SensitiveDataFilter`. **Status: Verified.**

**Conclusion:**
The project's key documentation is verified to be an accurate and reliable reflection of the codebase. The project is in a stable state, and the handover information is confirmed to be correct.
