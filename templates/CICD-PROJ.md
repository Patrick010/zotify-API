# CI/CD Philosophy and Quality Gates (For Project Management)

## 1. Purpose
This document provides a high-level overview of the Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a project. It is intended for a project management and stakeholder audience, explaining the purpose and value of each quality gate in the development process.

For a detailed technical guide for developers, please see the `cicd-dev.md` template.

## 2. Core Philosophy

The development process is built on two principles:

-   **Catch Errors Early and Locally:** Developers receive immediate feedback on their machines *before* they commit code. This is handled by automated "pre-commit hooks" and is designed to catch simple style or logic errors quickly, speeding up the development loop.
-   **Guarantee Centralized Quality:** Before any code can be merged into the `main` branch, it must pass a rigorous suite of automated checks in a clean, centralized environment (e.g., GitHub Actions). This is our ultimate guarantee of quality and stability.

## 3. The CI/CD Pipeline: Our Automated Quality Gates

When a developer submits a change, a series of automated jobs run to validate it. The change cannot be merged until all jobs pass.

### Key Jobs and Their Purpose:

-   **`test`**
    -   **Purpose:** To guarantee the application's logic works as expected and prevent regressions.
    -   **What it does:** Runs the entire suite of automated tests and verifies that test coverage does not fall below a critical threshold.

-   **`lint`**
    -   **Purpose:** To ensure the code is clean, readable, and consistent with project style guides.
    -   **What it does:** Uses industry-standard "linters" to check for stylistic errors and common code smells.

-   **`type-check`**
    -   **Purpose:** To catch bugs related to data types before the code is ever run.
    -   **What it does:** Uses a "static type checker" to analyze the code and ensure data flows correctly through the application.

-   **`security-scan`**
    -   **Purpose:** To proactively identify potential security vulnerabilities.
    -   **What it does:** Runs tools that scan the code for common security flaws and check dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

-   **`doc-linter`**
    -   **Purpose:** To enforce the project's "living documentation" policy automatically.
    -   **What it does:** Runs a custom script that ensures that whenever a developer changes code, they also update the project's documentation.

## 4. Conclusion

This automated pipeline serves as the foundation of a modern quality assurance strategy. It allows the development team to move quickly while providing project stakeholders with confidence that every change meets our high standards for correctness, style, security, and documentation.
