# <PROJECT_NAME> â€“ User-Driven Use Cases

This document captures realistic, demanding user scenarios that the API should ideally support.
These use cases go beyond basic operations, covering complex data manipulation,
advanced processing, and end-to-end synchronization between local and remote resources.

---

## 1. Merge and Sync Local + Remote Data
**Scenario:**
A user has multiple local data files (e.g., `.m3u` playlists, `.csv` files) and several data sets in a remote service (e.g., <Service_Provider> playlists). They want to:
- Merge a local file and a remote data set into a single master list.
- Remove duplicates regardless of source.
- Push the merged list back to the remote service as a new item.
- Save a local copy for offline use.

**Requirements:**
- Read and parse various local file formats.
- Read remote data and metadata from <Service_Provider>.
- Deduplicate across different sources.
- Create new items in the remote service.
- Export merged data to a local file.

## 2. Remote Resource Rebuild Based on Filters
**Scenario:**
A user wants to rebuild one of their remote resources (e.g., a playlist) entirely based on new criteria:
- Keep only items created in the last 5 years.
- Remove items with a duration under 2 minutes or over 10 minutes.
- Replace removed items with recommendations from the service's related items API.
- Overwrite the existing remote resource with the new version.

**Requirements:**
- Access and edit remote resources.
- Apply metadata filters (e.g., duration, release date).
- Fetch and insert recommendations from the service.
- Allow overwrite or "save as new" functionality.

---

## 3. Smart Auto-Download and Sync
**Scenario:**
A user wants to maintain a synchronized local copy of a remote resource:
- Whenever the remote resource changes, automatically download the new items locally.
- Remove local files for items that are no longer in the remote resource.
- Ensure local filenames and metadata tags are normalized for a specific use case (e.g., in-car playback).

**Requirements:**
- Remote resource change detection (e.g., via webhooks or polling).
- Download new items from the remote service.
- Delete removed items locally.
- Tag and normalize filenames according to user-defined rules.

---

## 4. Collaborative Hub with Version History
**Scenario:**
A group of users shares a collaborative resource. They want:
- A server-side history of all changes (add/remove) over time.
- The ability to roll back to a previous state and re-publish to the remote service.
- The ability to export changes as a changelog (e.g., date, item added/removed, user).

**Requirements:**
- Pull resource changes with timestamps and user info.
- Maintain historical snapshots of the resource.
- Restore a resource from a previous snapshot.
- Publish the restored resource back to the remote service.

---

## 5. Multi-Format, Multi-Quality Processing
**Scenario:**
A user wants a single API call to:
- Download items in the **highest available quality**.
- Convert to multiple formats at once (e.g., MP3, AAC, FLAC, ALAC).
- Organize outputs into separate directories for each format.

**Requirements:**
- Download in best available source quality.
- Perform batch conversion to multiple formats in parallel.
- Have a configurable output directory structure.
- Retain metadata across all conversions.

---

## 6. Fine-Grained Processing Settings
**Scenario:**
A user wants advanced control over processing parameters:
- Manually set bitrates (CBR, VBR, ABR).
- Choose specific sample rates (44.1kHz, 48kHz, 96kHz).
- Control channel layouts (mono, stereo, surround).
- Set custom compression parameters per format.

**Requirements:**
- Accept detailed transcoding/processing parameters per request.
- Support advanced flags in the backend (e.g., FFmpeg flags).
- Validate parameters for compatibility with the chosen codec/processor.
