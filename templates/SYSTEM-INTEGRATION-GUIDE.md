## 3. Core Architectural Principles

The project is built on a set of core principles to ensure it is maintainable, testable, and extensible.
-   **Layered Architecture:** Describe the layers of your application.
-   **Extensibility:** How can new features or providers be added?
-   **Error Handling:** What is the error handling strategy?
-   **Logging:** What is the logging strategy?

## 4. Code & Documentation Conventions

This project operates under a "living documentation" model.

-   **Reality First:** The codebase is the single source of truth. All documentation must reflect the actual, verified behavior of the application.
-   **Continuous Alignment:** All code changes must be accompanied by corresponding documentation updates in the same commit.
-   **Project Registry:** All markdown documentation must be registered in `project/PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` to be discoverable.

For a detailed checklist of tasks required for every change, please refer to `project/TASK_CHECKLIST.md`.
