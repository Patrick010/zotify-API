### Handover Brief: Repository Cleanup, QA Framework, and Next Steps

**1. Summary of Completed Work**

The commit I just submitted completes a major initiative to improve the project's organization, maintainability, and quality assurance processes. This work touched every module and established new, important conventions.

The key changes in this commit are:

*   **Comprehensive Repository Cleanup:**
    *   The root directory has been significantly decluttered. 8 utility scripts were moved into the `scripts/` directory, and their internal shebangs and paths were corrected.
    *   `DEPENDENCIES.md` was moved into the `project/` directory.
    *   5 obsolete files (like `.DS_Store`, temporary logs, etc.) were deleted.
    *   The `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` has been updated to reflect all file moves and deletions.

*   **New Code Quality Index Framework:**
    *   A new system for tracking the quality of every source file has been implemented across the entire project.
    *   You will find a new `CODE_QUALITY_INDEX.md` file in the `docs/reference/` directory of each of the three modules (`api`, `snitch`, and `gonk-testUI`).
    *   These files contain a table listing every source file and scoring it on two independent axes: **Documentation Quality** and **Code Quality**.
    *   The developer guides for each module have been updated with a detailed rubric explaining how these scores are determined.
    *   A complete, baseline assessment has been performed on **all** source files to populate these indexes, providing a starting point for future improvements.

*   **"Gold Standard" Documentation Example:**
    *   To provide a clear example of what 'A'-grade documentation looks like, I have created a comprehensive, standalone documentation file for `tracks_service.py`. You can find it at `api/docs/reference/source/tracks_service.py.md`. Please use this as a template for future documentation efforts.

*   **Process and Log Updates:**
    *   The `project/EXECUTION_PLAN.md` has been updated to include a formal **"Code QA"** step in every phase, ensuring quality is a consistent checkpoint.
    *   All three "Trinity" log files (`ACTIVITY.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`) have been fully updated to provide a complete and accurate record of all work performed in this session.

**2. Current Project State**

The project is in a very stable and well-documented state.
*   There are **no known bugs or blockers**.
*   The repository is logically organized.
*   The project's "living documentation" is accurate and can be trusted as the single source of truth for all ongoing work.

**3. Recommended Next Steps**

You have two primary paths you can take for your next task, both of which leverage the new systems I've put in place.

*   **Path 1: Quality Improvement (Recommended)**
    1.  **Familiarize yourself:** Start by reading the updated `API_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` to understand the new quality scoring rubric.
    2.  **Pick a target:** Go to one of the new `CODE_QUALITY_INDEX.md` files (e.g., for the `api` module) and find a file with a low score (a 'C' or 'D' in either documentation or code quality).
    3.  **Improve it:** Your task is to improve the quality of that file. This could mean writing comprehensive documentation (like the `tracks_service.py` example) or refactoring the code for clarity and adding tests.
    4.  **Update the index:** Once you've improved the file, update its score in the `CODE_QUALITY_INDEX.md` and add a brief note in the `Notes` column explaining what you did (e.g., "Refactored to improve clarity and added full unit test coverage.").

*   **Path 2: New Feature Development**
    1.  Consult the `project/EXECUTION_PLAN.md` to identify the next priority task.
    2.  As you work, remember that the plan now requires you to complete the **"Code QA"** step before you finish. This means you will be expected to assess the quality of any new code you write and update the relevant Code Quality Index.

No matter which path you choose, please continue to adhere to the project's core process of keeping the "Trinity" log files updated with your work. Good luck!
