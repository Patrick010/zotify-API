# Linter Enforcement Verification Report

**Date:** 2025-09-04
**Author:** Jules
**Objective:** To verify that `scripts/linter.py` enforces all required documentation and QA rules as per the provided checklist.

## 1. Enforcement Summary

The linter's enforcement of the documented rules is comprehensive and robust, with a few nuances noted below.

### 1.1. Fully Enforced Rules

The following checks are fully implemented and enforced by the linter's logic, primarily through the `scripts/doc-lint-rules.yml` configuration.

- **`MASTER_INDEX.md` Maintenance:** Changes within `api/docs/` correctly trigger a requirement to update `api/docs/MASTER_INDEX.md`.
- **`ALIGNMENT_MATRIX.md` Maintenance:** Changes to any code in the `api`, `snitch`, `gonk-testUI`, or `scripts` modules correctly trigger a requirement to update `project/ALIGNMENT_MATRIX.md`.
- **`CODE_QUALITY_INDEX.md` Maintenance:** Changes to any source file correctly trigger a requirement to update `api/docs/CODE_QUALITY_INDEX.md`.
- **`PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` Maintenance:** Changes within `project/` correctly trigger a requirement to update `project/PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`.
- **`QA_GOVERNANCE.md` Referencing:** Failure messages for the above rules correctly reference `QA_GOVERNANCE.md`, guiding the user to the relevant policy.
- **CI/CD Integration:** The `doc-linter` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` correctly invokes `scripts/linter.py` on all pull requests and pushes to main, blocking merges on failure.
- **`AGENTS.md` Documentation:** `AGENTS.md` correctly describes the linter's purpose and the enforcement workflow.
- **Documentation Update Policy:** The core policy of requiring documentation updates alongside code/doc changes is the fundamental purpose of the linter and is enforced by the combination of all the rules above.

### 1.2. Partially Enforced Rules

- **Link/Reference Validation:** The validation of internal references in documentation is not performed by `linter.py` itself. However, it is **indirectly** handled. The linter conditionally runs the `mkdocs build` command, which emits warnings for broken links. This provides visibility but does not cause the linter to fail. This is a reasonable approach, as failing on all broken links might be too strict.

### 1.3. Missing or Not Applicable Rules

- **Root Cause & Design Alignment Policy:** This is a human process policy, not a machine-enforceable rule. The linter enforces the *outcome* of this policy (e.g., requiring updates to `ALIGNMENT_MATRIX.md`), but it cannot enforce the policy itself. This is not a missing feature, but a clarification of scope.

## 2. Linter Implementation Locations

The enforcement logic is primarily located in two key areas:

1.  **Rule Configuration (`scripts/doc-lint-rules.yml`):** This file is the "brain" of the linter. It defines the relationships between source file paths and required documentation files. All the "Fully Enforced" rules listed above are explicitly defined here.

2.  **Rule Processing Logic (`scripts/linter.py`):**
    - The core logic for processing the rules defined in the YAML file resides in the `check_doc_matrix_rules` function. This function iterates through the rules, checks if any of the changed files match a rule's `source_paths`, and if so, ensures the corresponding `required_docs` are also present in the commit.
    - The CI/CD integration is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` under the `doc-linter` job.

---

## 3. False Positives & Negatives

During the validation testing, no false positives or false negatives were encountered regarding the documentation matrix rules. The linter behaved exactly as configured.

- **Test 1 (Code change, no docs):** Correctly **failed** with the expected error messages.
- **Test 2 (New doc, no index):** Correctly **failed** with the expected error messages.
- **Test 3 (Compliant change):** Correctly **passed** the documentation matrix check.

### Note on Environment Fragility

A significant finding during testing was the fragility of the linter's execution environment. The script attempts to run `pytest` and `mkdocs`, but their dependencies are not explicitly installed by the `doc-linter` CI job or any local setup script. This led to test failures unrelated to the documentation rules themselves (e.g., `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pydantic'`).

While this did not affect the verification of the documentation rules, it indicates a potential issue for the overall CI/CD process and local developer experience. The script's dependencies should be explicitly defined and installed.
