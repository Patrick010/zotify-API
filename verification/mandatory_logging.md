# Verification Report: Mandatory Logging Enforcement

**Date:** 2025-09-04
**Author:** Jules
**Objective:** To verify that the "Enforce Mandatory Logging" feature, as described in `project/HANDOVER_BRIEF.md`, is correctly implemented and functioning.

## 1. Summary of Findings

The "Enforce Mandatory Logging" feature is **correctly implemented and fully functional**.

The investigation began by confirming a contradiction between the `HANDOVER_BRIEF.md` (which stated the task was pending) and the `ACTIVITY.md` log (which stated the task was recently completed). An analysis of the linter script (`scripts/linter.py`) and its rules (`scripts/doc-lint-rules.yml`) confirmed that the implementation was indeed present.

A series of tests were then conducted using the linter's `--test-files` argument to validate the logic in a controlled environment.

## 2. Test Execution

### 2.1. Environment Preparation

The test environment was missing several Python packages required by the linter script. The following packages were installed via `pip` to enable the tests to run:
- `PyYAML`
- `mkdocs`
- `mkdocs-material`
- `mkdocs-monorepo-plugin`

### 2.2. Test Case 1: Failure Case (Non-Compliant Commit)

This test simulated a commit that did not include the three mandatory log files.

- **Command:** `python scripts/linter.py --test-files README.md`
- **Expected Result:** The linter should fail with an error about mandatory logging.
- **Actual Result:** The linter failed with the expected error message.
- **Conclusion:** **PASS**. The linter correctly identifies and fails non-compliant commits.

### 2.3. Test Case 2: Success Case (Compliant Commit)

This test simulated a commit that included all required log files and satisfied all other triggered documentation rules.

- **Command:** `python scripts/linter.py --test-files README.md project/logs/ACTIVITY.md project/logs/SESSION_LOG.md project/logs/CURRENT_STATE.md project/PROJECT_REGISTRY.md project/ALIGNMENT_MATRIX.md api/docs/CODE_QUALITY_INDEX.md api/docs/MASTER_INDEX.md`
- **Expected Result:** The linter should pass all checks and exit successfully.
- **Actual Result:** The linter passed all checks and exited with a success status.
- **Conclusion:** **PASS**. The linter correctly identifies and passes compliant commits.

## 3. Final Conclusion

The mandatory logging feature is working as designed. No corrective action or further implementation is required. This verification completes the task.
