# Audit Phase 4: Findings and Final Plan (Condensed)

This document summarizes the findings from the code audit and test suite restoration.

## 1. Findings

*   **Outdated Documentation:** Project status documents were inaccurate. The "Generic Error Handling Module" was found to be fully implemented, contrary to the documentation.
*   **Broken Test Suite:** The test suite was non-functional due to environment, configuration, and obsolete code issues.
*   **Code-Level Bugs:** After repairing the test suite, 50 test failures were identified and fixed. Key issues included:
    *   Database initialization errors.
    *   Poor test isolation practices (improper use of `dependency_overrides.clear()`).
    *   Missing mocks for external services, causing unintended network calls.
    *   A bug in the error handler's singleton implementation.

## 2. Outcome

The project is now in a stable state with a fully passing test suite (135/135 tests).

## 3. Proposed Next Steps

*   Complete the partial webhook implementation.
*   Refactor the provider abstraction to remove a temporary hack.
*   Update all project documentation to reflect the current state of the code.
