# Code Quality Index

## 1. Purpose

As per the project's commitment to quality and maintainability, this document serves as a central registry for the quality status of all source code files within the Zotify API. It provides a live snapshot of our code quality, helping to identify areas that need improvement or refactoring.

This index is for code files what the `project/PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` is for project documentation.

## 2. Scoring Rubric

Each file is assigned a quality score based on a holistic assessment. While the initial focus is on documentation, the score should reflect overall code quality.

-   **A (Excellent):** The code is clear, efficient, and easy to maintain. It has comprehensive documentation, including a module-level docstring, detailed function/class docstrings, and inline comments for complex logic. It is well-tested.
-   **B (Good):** The code is functional but could be improved. It may have basic documentation but lacks detail. Some complex areas might be uncommented or hard to follow. Test coverage may be incomplete.
-   **C (Needs Improvement):** The code is difficult to understand, has little to no documentation, and may lack sufficient test coverage. It is a candidate for refactoring.

| `api/src/zotify_api/database/__init__.py` | C | No quality assessment yet. |
| `api/src/zotify_api/database/crud.py` | B | Excellent function-level docstrings. A module-level docstring explaining the file's overall role as the primary database interface would make it an 'A'. |
| `api/src/zotify_api/database/models.py` | C | No module or class-level docstrings to explain the data model. A new developer would have to infer all table purposes and relationships from the code. |
| `api/src/zotify_api/database/session.py` | B | Clear and concise. The `get_db` dependency is well-documented. A module-level docstring would elevate it to an 'A'. |

| `api/src/zotify_api/logging_config.py` | C | No quality assessment yet. |
| `api/src/zotify_api/main.py` | B | Good structure and function-level documentation via FastAPI decorators. Missing a module-level docstring explaining the file's overall purpose and initialization sequence. |
