# API Module: Code Quality Index

## 1. Purpose

As per the project's commitment to quality and maintainability, this document serves as a central registry for the quality status of all source code files within the Zotify API. It provides a live snapshot of our code quality, helping to identify areas that need improvement or refactoring.

This index is for code files what the `project/PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` is for project documentation.

## 2. Scoring Rubric

Each file is assigned two quality scores: one for Documentation and one for Code.

### Documentation Score (`Doc Score`)
This score assesses the quality and completeness of the comments and docstrings.
-   **A (Excellent):** The file has a comprehensive module-level docstring. All classes and functions have detailed docstrings covering their goals, parameters, and return values. Complex logic is clarified with inline comments.
-   **B (Good):** The file has basic docstrings for the module and most functions/classes, but they may lack detail.
-   **C (Needs Improvement):** The file has missing or minimal docstrings and inline comments.

### Code Quality Score (`Code Score`)
This score assesses the quality of the implementation itself.
-   **A (Excellent):** The code is clear, efficient, well-structured, and adheres to design patterns. It has high test coverage.
-   **B (Good):** The code is functional but could be improved. It may contain some complex or hard-to-follow logic, or could be more efficient. Test coverage may be incomplete.
-   **C (Needs Improvement):** The code is difficult to understand, inefficient, or contains significant technical debt. It is a primary candidate for refactoring.
