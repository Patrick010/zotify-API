# Feature Specifications

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Purpose

This document serves as the master index for all detailed feature specifications for the Gonk platform. The purpose of this system is to ensure that every feature, endpoint, and function in the codebase has a corresponding, discoverable, and up-to-date specification.

This system is the single source of truth for understanding the purpose, design, and usage of any system functionality without needing to reverse-engineer the code.

## 2. Governance

-   **Live Document:** This, and all linked specifications, are live documents and must be updated continuously in sync with code changes.
-   **Mandatory for New Features:** Every new feature, endpoint, or function **must** have a corresponding spec entry created or updated as part of the implementation task.
-   **Pre-Merge Check:** All pull requests that introduce or modify functionality must include updates to the relevant feature specifications.
