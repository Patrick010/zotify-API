# Developer-Facing Flexible Logging Framework

## Overview

This module extends the current global error handling system into a fully programmable, developer-facing logging framework that becomes part of the API framework itself.
Its purpose is to allow fine-grained control over what gets logged, where it gets logged, and under what conditions â€” without requiring central configuration changes or scattered logging code.

## Objectives

- Enable multi-destination logging for simultaneous output to multiple targets.
- Allow developers to control logging per function, per API call, or per event.
- Integrate with the global error handler, but remain a standalone, reusable developer tool.
- Ensure minimal performance impact via asynchronous, non-blocking operation.

## Core Features
### 1. Multi-Destination Logging

- Supported destinations:
  - Local file(s) with rotation
  - Console
  - Syslog
  - HTTP/Webhook endpoints
  - Databases
  - Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc.)
- Ability to log to multiple destinations simultaneously.
- Destinations selectable per log event.

Example:
```
log_event("Payment processed",
          level="INFO",
          destinations=["audit_log", "webhook"],
          tags=["PAYMENT", "USER_123"])
```

### 2. Per-Event and Per-Function Control

- Developers can specify destinations, log levels, and tags inline.
- Overrides allowed without editing the global config.
- Optional context injection for:
  - User ID
  - Session ID
  - Provider
  - Endpoint name

### 3. Log Level Granularity

- Fully standard levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.
- Per-destination log level thresholds:
  - Console: WARNING+
  - File: DEBUG+
  - Webhook: ERROR only

### 4. Triggers & Actions

- Conditional triggers can run on specific log patterns or levels:
  - Send an alert
  - Trigger a webhook
  - Restart a service
- Trigger rules can be added/removed at runtime without restarting.

### 5. Developer API & Config Layer

- Public API functions for:
  - Creating/deleting log destinations
  - Attaching/detaching destinations at runtime
  - Setting per-destination log levels
  - Adding custom log formats
- Configurable via `logging_framework.yml` for persistence.

### 6. Performance & Safety

- Asynchronous write operations
- Lazy message evaluation (log only computed if event will be written)
- Batching for high-volume logs
- Failover destinations if one output is unavailable

### 7. Advanced Capabilities

- Structured log formats (JSON, XML)
- Tag-based filtering
- Automatic metadata injection
- Per-destination retention policies

### 8. Error Handling Integration

- All caught exceptions routed into this system by default
- Developers can override logging destinations for caught exceptions
- Critical security-related errors can automatically trigger alerts

### 9. Documentation & Examples

- Must be included in:
  - Developer reference guides (doc/)
  - API usage examples
  - Framework onboarding tutorials
- Example snippets showing:
  - Per-function logging
  - Multi-destination setup
  - Trigger creation
  - Structured JSON logging

## Implementation Phases

1. Core logging service (destinations, levels, routing)
2. Developer API layer with inline control
3. Trigger/action subsystem
4. Structured logging + metadata injection
5. Performance tuning and async optimization
6. Integration with existing error handler
