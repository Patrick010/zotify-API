# Proposal: Feature Specification for Provider-Agnostic Extensions

## 1. Purpose

This proposal extends the existing provider-agnostic design of the API by ensuring all features, endpoints, and modules—current and future—are documented with a consistent, detailed, and discoverable specification. While the API can already work across multiple providers, there is currently no formalized structure for documenting the expected behavior, capabilities, and metadata handling of each provider integration.

---

## 2. Scope

This applies to:

- Core API endpoints that interact with any provider.
- Supporting modules (Snitch, Gonk-TestUI, and similar).
- Future enhancements or integrations with additional audio providers.

All features, whether provider-specific or provider-agnostic, must have a clear specification entry.

---

## 3. Motivation

Currently, new provider integrations are added with inconsistent documentation. Developers, maintainers, and auditors must reverse-engineer behavior or metadata coverage. Formalizing specifications ensures clarity, traceability, and consistent expectations across all provider integrations.

---

## 4. Feature Specification Structure

Each feature—core or provider-agnostic extension—must include:

- **Feature Name**
- **Module/Component**
- **Purpose / Business Value**
- **Description of Functionality**
- **Technical Details** (logic, workflows, algorithms, and provider-specific nuances)
- **Associated Endpoints or Functions**
- **Inputs & Outputs**
- **Dependencies**
- **Supported Configurations** (formats, codecs, provider-specific options)
- **Examples** (CLI, API requests, provider scenarios)
- **Edge Cases / Limitations**
- **Testing & Validation Notes**
- **Related Documentation** (cross-links to HLD, LLD, FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md)

---

## 5. Integration with Provider-Agnostic Architecture

- Clearly indicate which features are provider-agnostic and which extend or depend on specific provider capabilities.
- Include metadata coverage and supported capabilities for each provider in the specification.
- Provide a “provider adapter interface” reference for features that interact with multiple providers.
- Document variations in behavior or limitations per provider.

---

## 6. Implementation Plan

1. Create a dedicated section in the documentation tree:

docs/reference/FEATURE_SPECS.md
docs/reference/features/
audio_processing.md
webhooks.md
provider_extensions.md


2. Retroactively document all existing provider integrations with detailed feature specifications.
3. Ensure every new feature or provider integration has its spec entry before or at implementation.
4. Include cross-links to:

- `ENDPOINTS.md`
- `SYSTEM_SPECIFICATIONS.md`
- `ROADMAP.md`
- `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`

5. Reference `FEATURE_SPECS.md` in `PID.md`, `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`, and other dev-flow documents.

---

## 7. Metadata & Capability Matrix

For provider-agnostic features extended to multiple providers, include a table that shows:

- Supported metadata fields per provider
- Supported operations (playlists, tracks, albums, encoding options)
- Any provider-specific limitations or differences

---

## 8. Pre-Merge Checks

- CI/CD pipeline must enforce that any new provider feature includes a completed spec entry.
- Missing metadata coverage or incomplete specifications block merges.

---

## 9. Testing & Validation

- Standardized test suite should validate:

- Feature behavior against all supported providers
- Metadata completeness and accuracy
- Correct operation of provider adapter interface

---

## 10. Enforcement & Maintenance

- Treat `FEATURE_SPECS.md` as a live document.
- Quarterly reviews to catch gaps or outdated specifications.
- Continuous integration ensures alignment with provider capabilities.

---

## 11. Developer Guidance

- When extending the API with new provider features, follow the existing provider-agnostic interface.
- Document differences, limitations, or provider-specific configurations in the spec entry.
- Ensure examples cover all supported providers.

---

## 12. Auditing & Traceability

- Features linked to providers and metadata coverage are fully traceable via `FEATURE_SPECS.md`.
- Auditors can immediately understand capabilities without reverse-engineering code.

---

## 13. Future-Proofing

- Specifications include placeholders for planned provider enhancements.
- The “provider adapter interface” ensures new providers can be added consistently.
- Metadata and capability tables prevent drift between API behavior and documentation.

---

## 14. Outcome

- Every feature and provider extension has a discoverable, complete, and up-to-date specification.
- Developers can confidently implement, extend, and audit provider-agnostic features.
- Maintenance and onboarding complexity is reduced.
