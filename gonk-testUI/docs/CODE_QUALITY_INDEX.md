# Gonk-TestUI Module: Code Quality Index

## 1. Purpose

This document serves as a central registry for the quality status of all source code files within the **Gonk-TestUI** module. It provides a live snapshot of our code quality, helping to identify areas that need improvement or refactoring.

## 2. Scoring Rubric

Each file is assigned a quality score based on a holistic assessment.

-   **A (Excellent):** The code is clear, efficient, and easy to maintain. It has comprehensive documentation or is self-explanatory due to its structure (e.g., semantic HTML, well-structured CSS).
-   **B (Good):** The code is functional but could be improved. It may have basic documentation but lacks detail.
-   **C (Needs Improvement):** The code is difficult to understand and has little to no documentation.

## 3. Source Code Index

| File Path | Code Quality Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `gonk-testUI/app.py` | C | The functions for managing the `sqlite-web` subprocess are complex and lack docstrings to explain their logic and state management. Core Flask routes are clear but would benefit from docstrings. |
| `gonk-testUI/static/app.js` | B | Excellent inline comments and logical grouping. The lack of file-level and function-level docstrings makes it difficult to get a high-level understanding of the UI's complex state management. |
| `gonk-testUI/static/styles.css` | A | Excellent use of CSS variables for theming and a clear, logical structure. The code is easy to read and maintain. |
| `gonk-testUI/templates/index.html` | A | Clean, semantic HTML5 structure. The separation of concerns is good, though the theme-toggle style could be moved to the main CSS file for perfect separation. |
