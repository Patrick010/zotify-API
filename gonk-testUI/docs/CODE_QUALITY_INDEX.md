# Gonk-TestUI Module: Code Quality Index

## 1. Purpose

This document serves as a central registry for the quality status of all source code files within the **Gonk-TestUI** module. It provides a live snapshot of our code quality, helping to identify areas that need improvement or refactoring.

## 2. Scoring Rubric

Each file is assigned two quality scores: one for Documentation and one for Code.

### Documentation Score (`Doc Score`)
This score assesses the quality and completeness of the comments and docstrings.
-   **A (Excellent):** The file has comprehensive documentation or is self-explanatory due to its structure (e.g., semantic HTML, well-structured CSS).
-   **B (Good):** The file has basic documentation but lacks detail.
-   **C (Needs Improvement):** The file has missing or minimal documentation.

### Code Quality Score (`Code Score`)
This score assesses the quality of the implementation itself.
-   **A (Excellent):** The code is clear, efficient, well-structured, and adheres to design patterns.
-   **B (Good):** The code is functional but could be improved.
-   **C (Needs Improvement):** The code is difficult to understand, inefficient, or contains significant technical debt.

## 3. Source Code Index

| File Path | Doc Score | Code Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gonk-testUI/app.py` | C | B | The core Flask routes are clear, but the functions for managing the `sqlite-web` subprocess are complex and lack docstrings. |
| `gonk-testUI/static/app.js` | B | B | Excellent inline comments, but lacks function-level docstrings for complex UI state management. |
| `gonk-testUI/static/styles.css` | A | A | Excellent use of CSS variables and a clear, logical structure. |
| `gonk-testUI/templates/index.html` | A | A | Clean, semantic HTML5 structure. |
