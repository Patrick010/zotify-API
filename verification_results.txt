Verification Task: Check for implementation of the "Comprehensive Feature Specification Documentation" system.

Methodology:
I searched the entire repository for the key filename "FEATURE_SPECS.md" and for any references to it in project governance documents.

Result:
The system has not been implemented.

Evidence:
A `grep` search returned only a single reference to "FEATURE_SPECS.md": a line in `project/CURRENT_STATE.md` that describes the implementation of this system as the "next immediate step" for the project. No other files reference it, and the file itself does not exist.

Conclusion:
The previous developer did not begin this task. The project is pending the implementation of this feature specification system.
