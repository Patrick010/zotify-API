# Extendable Logging System – Phased Implementation

This document tracks the phased design and implementation of the new Extendable Logging System.
All phases are aligned with the project’s roadmap and traceability requirements.

---

## Status Overview

- ✅ **Phase 1 – Core Service**: In Progress (LoggingService foundation, async core, modular architecture).
- ✅ **Phase 2 – Developer API**: In Progress (developer-friendly API for log calls, config loader, per-module log assignment).
- ⏳ **Phase 3 – Configurable Destinations & Multi-Sink Expansion**: TODO.
- ⏳ **Phase 4 – Runtime Triggers & Actions**: TODO.
- ⏳ **Phase 5 – Observability Integration**: TODO.
- ⏳ **Phase 6 – Security & Compliance Layer**: TODO.
- ⏳ **Phase 7 – Developer Extensibility Framework**: TODO.
- ⏳ **Phase 8 – Full Observability Suite** (Optional Long-Term): TODO.

## Phase Details

### Phase 1 – Core Service *(In Progress)*
- Build central `LoggingService`.
- Provide async, thread-safe logging pipeline.
- Modular structure for sinks (file, console, webhook).
- Configurable log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL).

### Phase 2 – Developer API *(In Progress)*
- Expose API for structured logging.
- Enable per-function/module loglevel + destination selection.
- YAML-based configuration (`logging_framework.yml`).
- Config reload without restart.

### Phase 3 – Configurable Destinations & Multi-Sink Expansion *(TODO)*
- Add Syslog, DB, Kafka, RabbitMQ sinks.
- Per-module sink assignment.
- Rotation & retention policies.

### Phase 4 – Runtime Triggers & Actions *(TODO)*
- Configurable event triggers.
- Multiple trigger actions (alert, escalate, suppress).
- Hot reload of triggers.
- Support chained triggers.

### Phase 5 – Observability Integration *(TODO)*
- OpenTelemetry exporters.
- Prometheus metrics from logs.
- Structured JSON logs for ELK/EFK.
- Correlation/trace IDs.

### Phase 6 – Security & Compliance Layer *(TODO)*
- Structured, immutable audit stream.
- Redaction of secrets/sensitive data.
- Log classification (normal, audit, security).
- GDPR/Privacy compliance alignment.

### Phase 7 – Developer Extensibility Framework *(TODO)*
- Logging adapter API.
- Example adapters (Slack, Discord, custom webhooks).
- Developer documentation for writing sinks.

### Phase 8 – Full Observability Suite *(TODO, Long-Term)*
- Centralized dashboard.
- Real-time log subscriptions (WebSocket/SSE).
- Anomaly detection/AI-assisted log insights (research).

## Governance

- This file is authoritative for all logging-related work.
- Updates must be reflected in:
  - `project/ROADMAP.md`
  - `project/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`
- All phases must include:
  - Design spec (`project/LOGGING_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`).
  - Developer-facing guide (`api/docs/manuals/LOGGING_GUIDE.md`).
  - Compliance mapping (`project/LOGGING_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`).
