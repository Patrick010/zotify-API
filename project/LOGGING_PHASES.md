# Extendable Logging System – Phased Implementation

> **Purpose of this Document**
> This file is the **authoritative tracker** for the Extendable Logging System.
> It defines each phase, current status, deliverables, and governance rules.
>
> **How to Maintain**
> - Update the status markers (`In Progress`, `TODO`, `Done`) as work progresses.
> - Add links to design docs, code directories, or reports under each phase.
> - Keep this document in sync with:
>   - `project/ROADMAP.md` (high-level timeline/phase overview).
>   - `project/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` (requirement-to-phase mapping).
> - Do not remove phases, even if deferred — mark them as *Deferred* or *Obsolete*.
>
> This file ensures that logging development is transparent, traceable, and never “lost in the cracks.”

This document tracks the phased design and implementation of the new Extendable Logging System.
All phases are aligned with the project’s roadmap and traceability requirements.

## Status Overview

- ✅ **Phase 1 – Core Service**: In Progress (LoggingService foundation, async core, modular architecture).
- ✅ **Phase 2 – Developer API**: In Progress (developer-friendly API for log calls, config loader, per-module log assignment).
- ⏳ **Phase 3 – Configurable Destinations & Multi-Sink Expansion**: TODO.
- ⏳ **Phase 4 – Runtime Triggers & Actions**: TODO.
- ⏳ **Phase 5 – Observability Integration**: TODO.
- ⏳ **Phase 6 – Security & Compliance Layer**: TODO.
- ⏳ **Phase 7 – Developer Extensibility Framework**: TODO.
- ⏳ **Phase 8 – Full Observability Suite** (Optional Long-Term): TODO.

## Phase Details

### Phase 1 – Core Service *(In Progress)*
- Build central `LoggingService`.
- Provide async, thread-safe logging pipeline.
- Modular structure for sinks (file, console, webhook).
- Configurable log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL).

### Phase 2 – Developer API *(In Progress)*
- Expose API for structured logging.
- Enable per-function/module loglevel + destination selection.
- YAML-based configuration (`logging_framework.yml`).
- Config reload without restart.

### Phase 3 – Configurable Destinations & Multi-Sink Expansion *(TODO)*
- Add Syslog, DB, Kafka, RabbitMQ sinks.
- Per-module sink assignment.
- Rotation & retention policies.

### Phase 4 – Runtime Triggers & Actions *(TODO)*
- Configurable event triggers.
- Multiple trigger actions (alert, escalate, suppress).
- Hot reload of triggers.
- Support chained triggers.

### Phase 5 – Observability Integration *(TODO)*
- OpenTelemetry exporters.
- Prometheus metrics from logs.
- Structured JSON logs for ELK/EFK.
- Correlation/trace IDs.

### Phase 6 – Security & Compliance Layer *(TODO)*
- Structured, immutable audit stream.
- Redaction of secrets/sensitive data.
- Log classification (normal, audit, security).
- GDPR/Privacy compliance alignment.

### Phase 7 – Developer Extensibility Framework *(TODO)*
- Logging adapter API.
- Example adapters (Slack, Discord, custom webhooks).
- Developer documentation for writing sinks.

### Phase 8 – Full Observability Suite *(TODO, Long-Term)*
- Centralized dashboard.
- Real-time log subscriptions (WebSocket/SSE).
- Anomaly detection/AI-assisted log insights (research).

## Governance

- This file is authoritative for all logging-related work.
- Updates must be reflected in:
  - `project/ROADMAP.md`
  - `project/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`
- All phases must include:
  - Design spec (`project/LOGGING_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`).
  - Developer-facing guide (`api/docs/manuals/LOGGING_GUIDE.md`).
  - Compliance mapping (`project/LOGGING_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`).
