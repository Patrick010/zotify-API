# Phase 4 Traceability Matrix

**Status:** Live Document
**Date:** 2025-08-26

## 1. Purpose

This document maps the high-level goals for Phase 4, as defined in the `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md`, to the detailed action plan in `CODE_OPTIMIZATIONPLAN_PHASE_4.md` ("Super-Lint" plan). It ensures end-to-end traceability for the "Enforce & Automate" initiative.

## 2. Traceability Matrix

| HLD/LLD Phase | Goal (from Super-Lint Plan) | Detailed Task ID (Super-Lint) | Implementation Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 4a** | Prerequisite: Technical Debt Remediation | `TD-TASK-01`, `TD-TASK-02`, `TD-TASK-03` | ‚úÖ Done | All baseline configs created and critical issues remediated. |
| **Phase 4b** | Foundational Static Analysis (CI Integration) | `SL-TASK-01`, `SL-TASK-02` | ‚úÖ Done | All linters integrated and running in enforcement mode in CI. |
| **Phase 4b** | Foundational Static Analysis (Go Security) | `gosec` (Implied in `SL-TASK-01`) | ‚úÖ Done | `gosec` linter enabled in `.golangci.yml` and one issue (G107) was remediated. |
| **Phase 4c** | Custom Architectural & Documentation Linting | `SL-TASK-03` | üèÉ Partially Done | An MVP of the linter is implemented. Advanced features are deferred. See note in `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md`. |
| **Phase 4d** | Deep Code Review Process (Checklist & Rubric) | `SL-TASK-04` | ‚úÖ Done | `TASK_CHECKLIST.md` updated with a formal checklist and scoring rubric. |
| **Phase 4d** | Local Enforcement (Pre-commit Hooks) | `SL-TASK-05` | üèÉ Partially Done | Pre-commit hook for the doc linter is implemented. Hooks for `ruff` and `golangci-lint` are deferred. See note in `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md`. |
