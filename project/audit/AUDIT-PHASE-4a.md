# Audit Phase 4a: Technical Debt Remediation

**Date:** 2025-08-20
**Author:** Jules
**Objective:** To track the execution of the tasks defined in the `CODE_OPTIMIZATIONPLAN_PHASE_4.md` and to ensure that all quality gates and automation are in place to prevent future design drift.

### Summary of Activities

This phase focuses on introducing a suite of static analysis tools to establish a clean, high-quality baseline for the codebase.

**1. Tool Configuration:**
*   **`ruff.toml`:** Created a baseline configuration for the `ruff` linter, enabling a comprehensive set of rules for code style and quality.
*   **`mypy.ini`:** Established a `mypy` configuration to begin enforcing type safety. Initial setup is not strict to allow for incremental adoption.
*   **`.golangci.yml`:** Created a configuration file for the `golangci-lint` tool to ensure the Go-based microservice (`snitch`) adheres to best practices.

**2. Initial Code Remediation:**
*   **MyPy Module Conflicts:** Resolved initial `mypy` errors related to module naming conflicts by renaming `api/src/zotify_api/providers/spotify_connector.py` to `api/src/zotify_api/providers/spotify.py` and deleting a conflicting `zotify/zotify.py` file.
*   **Bandit Security Scan:** Ran `bandit -r api/` to identify security vulnerabilities. One medium-severity issue related to the use of `requests` without a timeout was identified and subsequently mitigated by adding a default timeout.
*   **Ruff Linting:**
    *   Executed `ruff check . --fix` to automatically correct a large number of linting errors.
    *   An initial run identified 213 remaining errors that require manual intervention, primarily `E501` (line too long) and `E402` (module import not at top of file).

**3. Current Blocker:**
*   **Ruff Configuration Issue:** The execution of `ruff` is currently blocked. The tool appears to be using a misconfigured `pyproject.toml` at the repository root, causing it to report errors with incorrect file paths (e.g., pointing to a non-existent top-level `src` directory instead of the correct `api/src`). This prevents effective manual remediation of the remaining 213 issues. The immediate next step was to inspect and correct this `pyproject.toml` file before work was halted.
