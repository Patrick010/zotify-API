# Audit Phase 4: Findings and Final Plan (Condensed)

This document summarizes the findings from the code audit and test suite restoration.

## 1. Findings

*   **Outdated Documentation:** Project status documents were inaccurate. The "Generic Error Handling Module" was found to be fully implemented, contrary to the documentation.
*   **Broken Test Suite:** The test suite was non-functional due to environment, configuration, and obsolete code issues.
*   **Code-Level Bugs:** After repairing the test suite, 50 test failures were identified and fixed. Key issues included:
    *   Database initialization errors.
    *   Poor test isolation practices (improper use of `dependency_overrides.clear()`).
    *   Missing mocks for external services, causing unintended network calls.
    *   A bug in the error handler's singleton implementation.

## 2. Outcome

The project is now in a stable state with a fully passing test suite (135/135 tests).

## 3. Proposed Next Steps

*   Complete the partial webhook implementation.
*   Refactor the provider abstraction to remove a temporary hack.
*   Update all project documentation to reflect the current state of the code.

## 4. Session Report (2025-08-15): Documentation and Process Hardening

This session focused on interpreting and strengthening the project's documentation and development processes.

### 4.1. Documentation Policy Interpretation
- A deep dive was conducted into the project's documentation policies by analyzing `PID.md`, `HLD.md`, `LLD.md`, and the audit trail.
- The core policy was identified as "living documentation," requiring docs to be updated in lock-step with code.
- Key enforcement gaps were identified, such as the missing `TASK_CHECKLIST.md`.

### 4.2. Process Implementation: Task Backlog Mechanism
A new, formal "Task Backlog Mechanism" was implemented to enforce stricter process discipline.
- **`BACKLOG.md`:** Overwritten with a new structured template, requiring tasks to have a source, acceptance criteria, dependencies, etc.
- **`PID.md`:** Updated to formally document the new rules for backlog management and task qualification.
- **`TASK_CHECKLIST.md`:** Updated with a new mandatory "Task Qualification" step, requiring developers to manually verify a task's readiness against the new rules before starting work.
- **`PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`:** Updated to reflect the new, more formal backlog process.

### 4.3. Documentation Cleanup
- The missing `TASK_CHECKLIST.md` was located in the `project/archive` and restored to `project/`.
- The outdated, hardcoded file list within `TASK_CHECKLIST.md` was removed and replaced with a reference to the `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`.
