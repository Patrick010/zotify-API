## 7. Task: Fix Startup Script and Token Storage Regression

**Date:** 2025-08-12
**Status:** ✅ Done

### 7.1. Problem
A regression was identified where Spotify OAuth tokens were being saved to a JSON file instead of the unified database. The root cause was a faulty `scripts/start.sh` script that failed to set the `PYTHONPATH` correctly. This resulted in the application running a stale, globally installed version of the package instead of the up-to-date local source code.

### 7.2. Changes Made
1.  **`scripts/start.sh`:**
    *   Modified the `uvicorn` command to prepend `PYTHONPATH=./src`. This ensures the local, correct source code is always used.
2.  **Code Verification:**
    *   Confirmed that the existing code in `api/src/zotify_api/services/auth.py` and `api/src/zotify_api/database/crud.py` correctly handles saving tokens to the database. The issue was purely environmental.

### 7.3. Outcome
The application startup script is now robust and correctly uses the local source code, fixing the token storage regression. The system now behaves as designed, storing all persistent data in the unified database.

## 6. Task: Implement Unified Database Architecture

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** ✅ Done

### 6.1. Problem
The application used multiple, inconsistent persistence mechanisms, including file-based storage (`playlists.json`, `spotify_tokens.json`) and a single-purpose SQLite database for downloads. This was not scalable, secure, or maintainable. A unified, backend-agnostic database layer was required.

### 6.2. Changes Made
1.  **Architectural Refactoring:**
    *   A new database layer was created at `api/src/zotify_api/database/` using SQLAlchemy.
    *   This layer includes a configurable session manager, ORM models for all application data, and a set of CRUD functions.
2.  **Service Migration:**
    *   The Download Service, Playlist Storage, and Spotify Token Storage were all refactored to use the new unified database layer.
    *   The old persistence mechanisms (JSON files, standalone SQLite DB) were removed.
3.  **Testing:**
    *   The test suite was updated to use the new database architecture, with isolated in-memory databases for each test run.
4.  **Documentation:**
    *   The `HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md`, `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md`, and `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` were all updated to reflect the new architecture.

### 6.3. Outcome
The application now has a robust, centralized, and backend-agnostic persistence layer. This improves scalability, maintainability, and security, and provides a solid foundation for future development.

## 5. Task: Implement Persistent Download Queue

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** ✅ Done

### 5.1. Problem
The `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a high-priority gap for the "Downloads Subsystem". The initial implementation used a temporary, in-memory queue, which was not suitable for production.

### 5.2. Changes Made
1.  **Code Implementation:**
    *   Created a new database module `api/src/zotify_api/services/downloads_db.py` to manage a persistent queue using SQLite.
    *   Refactored `api/src/zotify_api/services/download_service.py` to use the new database module, replacing the in-memory queue.
2.  **Testing:**
    *   Updated the test suite in `api/tests/test_download.py` to use a temporary, isolated database for each test, ensuring the new implementation is robustly tested.
3.  **Documentation Updates:**
    *   Updated `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` to describe the new SQLite-based persistent queue.
    *   Updated `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` to mark the "Downloads Subsystem" gap as fully closed (`Matches Design? = Y`).

### 5.3. Outcome
The "Downloads Subsystem" now has a production-ready, persistent job queue. This closes a critical, high-priority gap identified in the audit.

## 1. Task: Align Admin Endpoint Security Documentation

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** ✅ Done

### 1.1. Problem

The `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a high-priority gap for "Admin Endpoint Security". The existing design documents were pointing to a non-existent `security.md` file and contained outdated information about the security model.

### 1.2. Changes Made

1.  **Created `docs/projectplan/security.md`:** A new, definitive security document was created by copying the archived (pre-audit) version and updating it to reflect the current implementation.
    *   The document now clearly separates the **Current Security Model** (static admin API key) from the **Future Enhancements** (JWT, rate limiting, etc.).
2.  **Updated `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`:** The entry for "Admin Endpoint Security" was updated to `Matches Design? = Y`, closing the documentation gap.
3.  **Updated `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md`:** The plan was updated to mark the beginning of Phase 3.

### 1.3. Outcome

The project's security documentation is now accurate and aligned with the current state of the codebase. This completes the first task of Phase 3.

## 2. Task: Implement Downloads Subsystem Queue Processor

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** ✅ Done

### 2.1. Problem

The `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a high-priority gap for the "Downloads Subsystem". The design specified a functional job queue, but the codebase only contained stubs.

### 2.2. Changes Made

1.  **Code Implementation:**
    *   Added `process_download_queue()` method to `DownloadsService` to process one job from the queue.
    *   Added a manual trigger endpoint `POST /api/download/process`.
    *   Fixed a bug in the `retry_failed_jobs` logic.
2.  **Testing:**
    *   Added a comprehensive test suite for the new functionality. All project tests pass.
3.  **Documentation Updates:**
    *   Updated `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` to reflect the new implementation.
    *   Updated `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` to mark the gap as partially closed.
    *   Updated `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` and `ROADMAP.md` to reflect the progress.

### 2.3. Outcome

The "Downloads Subsystem" now has a functional, in-memory job queue, closing the initial implementation gap. This completes this task as another item in the Alignment Plan's Phase 3.

## 3. Task: Align Error Handling & Logging Documentation

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** ✅ Done

### 3.1. Problem

The `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a medium-priority gap for "Error Handling & Logging". The implementation was inconsistent and did not match the ideal design of standardized error schemas and audit trails.

### 3.2. Changes Made

1.  **Investigation:** Analyzed the codebase to document the current ad-hoc implementation of error handling and logging.
2.  **`FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`:** Added the "ideal" design for standardized error handling and logging to this document.
3.  **`LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md`:** Added a new design section to accurately describe the current, inconsistent implementation.
4.  **`TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`:** Updated the entry for "Error Handling & Logging" to `Matches Design? = Y`, closing the documentation gap.

### 3.3. Outcome

The project's design documents now accurately reflect the current state of the error handling and logging system. The aspirational, standardized design is captured as a future goal. This completes this task as another item in the Alignment Plan's Phase 3.

## 4. Task: Align OAuth2 for Spotify Integration Documentation

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** ✅ Done

### 4.1. Problem

The `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a medium-priority gap for "OAuth2 for Spotify Integration". The design specified full CRUD/sync functionality, but the implementation was incomplete.

### 4.2. Changes Made

1.  **Investigation:** Analyzed the `spotify` service and client to determine the exact capabilities of the current integration. Confirmed that playlist CRUD is functional, but write-sync and full library management are not implemented.
2.  **`FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`:** Updated the entry for "Full Spotify OAuth2 Integration" to be more specific about the missing features (write-sync, full library management).
3.  **`LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md`:** Added a new design section to accurately describe the current, partial implementation.
4.  **`TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`:** Updated the entry for "OAuth2 for Spotify Integration" to `Matches Design? = Y (partial)`, closing the documentation gap.

### 4.3. Outcome

The project's design documents now accurately reflect the current state of the Spotify integration. The unimplemented features are captured as future goals. This completes this task as another item in the Alignment Plan's Phase 3.
