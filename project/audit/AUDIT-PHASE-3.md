## 9. Task: Align Documentation Practices

**Date:** 2025-08-12
**Status:** ✅ Done

### 9.1. Problem
The `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a high-priority gap for "Documentation Practices". The design documents mandated a "docs-first" workflow that was not being followed, creating a mismatch between the documented process and the actual process.

### 9.2. Changes Made
1.  **`HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` Update:** The "Documentation Governance" section was rewritten to reflect the current, pragmatic "living documentation" process. This new description accurately portrays the project's workflow during the audit and alignment phase.
2.  **Future Vision:** The updated text explicitly keeps the door open for adopting a more formal "docs-first" approach in future phases, once the project's design has stabilized.
3.  **`AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` Update:** The "Documentation Practices" row was updated to `Matches Design? = Y`, closing the final major documentation gap identified in the audit.

### 9.3. Outcome
The project's high-level design now accurately reflects its actual documentation processes, resolving the identified gap. This completes the final planned task of the documentation alignment phase.

## 8. Task: Align Configuration Management Documentation

**Date:** 2025-08-12
**Status:** ✅ Done

### 8.1. Problem
The `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a gap for "Config Management via API". The documentation was unclear and did not accurately reflect the existing implementation, which turned out to be a dual system for handling configuration.

### 8.2. Changes Made
1.  **Investigation:** Analyzed `config.py`, `routes/config.py`, and `services/config_service.py` to understand the dual-system approach. Confirmed that core settings are startup-only, while a separate service handles mutable application settings via a JSON file and API.
2.  **`LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` Update:** Added a new "Configuration Management" section to accurately describe the dual system, detailing the purpose, source, and mutability of each.
3.  **`FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md` Update:** Added the aspirational goal of a "Unified Configuration Management" system to the technical enhancements list.
4.  **`AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` Update:** Updated the "Config Management via API" row to `Matches Design? = Y` and added a note clarifying the resolution.

### 8.3. Outcome
The project's design documents now accurately reflect the current state of the configuration system. The documentation gap is closed, and the potential for a future, unified system is recorded.

## 7. Task: Consolidate Terminology, Scopes, and Processes

**Date:** 2025-08-12
**Status:** ✅ Done

### 7.1. Problem
During ongoing work, several small but important alignment tasks were identified:
1. The term "Adapter" was used for the provider abstraction layer, but "Connector" was deemed more accurate.
2. The Spotify integration requested a minimal set of permissions (scopes), limiting its potential functionality.
3. The process for handling postponed tasks was undefined, leading to clutter in the `ACTIVITY.md` log.
4. Obsolete storage directories and files were present in the repository.

### 7.2. Changes Made
1.  **Terminology Refactor:** The term "Adapter" was replaced with "Connector" across all code, documentation, and project management files.
2.  **Scope Expansion:** The Spotify authorization request was updated to include all standard scopes, enabling the broadest possible functionality.
3.  **Process Formalization:** New rules were added to `PID.md` and `CURRENT_STATE.md` to formalize the handling of postponed tasks and the requirement to log all significant changes in documentation. The status of a blocked task in `ACTIVITY.md` was updated to `Obsolete`.
4.  **Storage Cleanup:** Redundant storage directories and obsolete `.json` data files were removed from the repository.

### 7.3. Outcome
The project's terminology is now more consistent, its capabilities are expanded, and its development processes are more clearly defined and documented. The repository is cleaner and more aligned with the current architecture.

## 6. Task: Implement Unified Database Architecture

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** ✅ Done

### 6.1. Problem
The application used multiple, inconsistent persistence mechanisms, including file-based storage (`playlists.json`, `spotify_tokens.json`) and a single-purpose SQLite database for downloads. This was not scalable, secure, or maintainable. A unified, backend-agnostic database layer was required.

### 6.2. Changes Made
1.  **Architectural Refactoring:**
    *   A new database layer was created at `api/src/zotify_api/database/` using SQLAlchemy.
    *   This layer includes a configurable session manager, ORM models for all application data, and a set of CRUD functions.
2.  **Service Migration:**
    *   The Download Service, Playlist Storage, and Spotify Token Storage were all refactored to use the new unified database layer.
    *   The old persistence mechanisms (JSON files, standalone SQLite DB) were removed.
3.  **Testing:**
    *   The test suite was updated to use the new database architecture, with isolated in-memory databases for each test run.
4.  **Documentation:**
    *   The `HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md`, `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md`, and `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` were all updated to reflect the new architecture.

### 6.3. Outcome
The application now has a robust, centralized, and backend-agnostic persistence layer. This improves scalability, maintainability, and security, and provides a solid foundation for future development.

## 5. Task: Implement Persistent Download Queue

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** ✅ Done

### 5.1. Problem
The `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a high-priority gap for the "Downloads Subsystem". The initial implementation used a temporary, in-memory queue, which was not suitable for production.

### 5.2. Changes Made
1.  **Code Implementation:**
    *   Created a new database module `api/src/zotify_api/services/downloads_db.py` to manage a persistent queue using SQLite.
    *   Refactored `api/src/zotify_api/services/download_service.py` to use the new database module, replacing the in-memory queue.
2.  **Testing:**
    *   Updated the test suite in `api/tests/test_download.py` to use a temporary, isolated database for each test, ensuring the new implementation is robustly tested.
3.  **Documentation Updates:**
    *   Updated `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` to describe the new SQLite-based persistent queue.
    *   Updated `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` to mark the "Downloads Subsystem" gap as fully closed (`Matches Design? = Y`).

### 5.3. Outcome
The "Downloads Subsystem" now has a production-ready, persistent job queue. This closes a critical, high-priority gap identified in the audit.

## 1. Task: Align Admin Endpoint Security Documentation

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** ✅ Done

### 1.1. Problem

The `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a high-priority gap for "Admin Endpoint Security". The existing design documents were pointing to a non-existent `security.md` file and contained outdated information about the security model.

### 1.2. Changes Made

1.  **Created `docs/projectplan/security.md`:** A new, definitive security document was created by copying the archived (pre-audit) version and updating it to reflect the current implementation.
    *   The document now clearly separates the **Current Security Model** (static admin API key) from the **Future Enhancements** (JWT, rate limiting, etc.).
2.  **Updated `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`:** The entry for "Admin Endpoint Security" was updated to `Matches Design? = Y`, closing the documentation gap.
3.  **Updated `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md`:** The plan was updated to mark the beginning of Phase 3.

### 1.3. Outcome

The project's security documentation is now accurate and aligned with the current state of the codebase. This completes the first task of Phase 3.

## 2. Task: Implement Downloads Subsystem Queue Processor

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** ✅ Done

### 2.1. Problem

The `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a high-priority gap for the "Downloads Subsystem". The design specified a functional job queue, but the codebase only contained stubs.

### 2.2. Changes Made

1.  **Code Implementation:**
    *   Added `process_download_queue()` method to `DownloadsService` to process one job from the queue.
    *   Added a manual trigger endpoint `POST /api/download/process`.
    *   Fixed a bug in the `retry_failed_jobs` logic.
2.  **Testing:**
    *   Added a comprehensive test suite for the new functionality. All project tests pass.
3.  **Documentation Updates:**
    *   Updated `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` to reflect the new implementation.
    *   Updated `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` to mark the gap as partially closed.
    *   Updated `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` and `ROADMAP.md` to reflect the progress.

### 2.3. Outcome

The "Downloads Subsystem" now has a functional, in-memory job queue, closing the initial implementation gap. This completes this task as another item in the Alignment Plan's Phase 3.

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** ✅ Done

### 3.1. Problem

The `AUDIT_AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a medium-priority gap for "Error Handling & Logging". The implementation was inconsistent and did not match the ideal design of standardized error schemas and audit trails.

### 3.2. Changes Made

1.  **Investigation:** Analyzed the codebase to document the current ad-hoc implementation of error handling and logging.
2.  **`FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`:** Added the "ideal" design for standardized error handling and logging to this document.
3.  **`LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md`:** Added a new design section to accurately describe the current, inconsistent implementation.
4.  **`AUDIT_AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`:** Updated the entry for "Error Handling & Logging" to `Matches Design? = Y`, closing the documentation gap.

### 3.3. Outcome

The project's design documents now accurately reflect the current state of the error handling and logging system. The aspirational, standardized design is captured as a future goal. This completes this task as another item in the Alignment Plan's Phase 3.

## 4. Task: Align OAuth2 for Spotify Integration Documentation

**Date:** 2025-08-11
**Status:** ✅ Done

### 4.1. Problem

The `AUDIT_AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a medium-priority gap for "OAuth2 for Spotify Integration". The design specified full CRUD/sync functionality, but the implementation was incomplete.

### 4.2. Changes Made

1.  **Investigation:** Analyzed the `spotify` service and client to determine the exact capabilities of the current integration. Confirmed that playlist CRUD is functional, but write-sync and full library management are not implemented.
2.  **`FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`:** Updated the entry for "Full Spotify OAuth2 Integration" to be more specific about the missing features (write-sync, full library management).
3.  **`LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md`:** Added a new design section to accurately describe the current, partial implementation.
4.  **`AUDIT_AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`:** Updated the entry for "OAuth2 for Spotify Integration" to `Matches Design? = Y (partial)`, closing the documentation gap.

### 4.3. Outcome

The project's design documents now accurately reflect the current state of the Spotify integration. The unimplemented features are captured as future goals. This completes this task as another item in the Alignment Plan's Phase 3.
