### Task: Implement Automated Documentation Workflow Tooling

*   **Reason & Goal:** To fulfill the requirements of Audit Phase 5 by implementing the "Advanced Conditional Documentation Linter" and its associated tooling, as outlined in the `HANDOVER_BRIEF.md` and `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md`. The goal is to create a robust, automated system for enforcing the project's "Living Documentation" policy.
*   **Status:** âœ… Done
*   **Summary of Activities:**
    1.  **File Operations:** Performed all required file setup, including renaming `scripts/roadmap-test.sh` to `scripts/run_lint.sh`, moving `project/lint-rules.yml` to `scripts/doc-lint-rules.yml`, and creating placeholder `mkdocs.yml` and `scripts/log-work.py` files.
    2.  **Dependency Management:** Added `mkdocs`, `mkdocs-material`, and `pydoc-markdown` to the development dependencies in `api/pyproject.toml` and installed them.
    3.  **Startup Script Updated:** Modified `scripts/start.sh` to launch the `mkdocs serve` documentation server in the background for developers.
    4.  **`log-work.py` Implemented:** Implemented the full logic for the `scripts/log-work.py` tool, which automates the updating of the three "Trinity" log files (`ACTIVITY.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`).
    5.  **`lint-docs.py` Enhanced:** Significantly enhanced the `scripts/lint-docs.py` script.
        - Corrected the path to the rules file.
        - **Added a new `forbidden_docs` feature** based on user feedback, allowing rules to prevent changes to certain files (e.g., point-in-time reports).
        - Refactored the script for better clarity and maintainability.
    6.  **Linter Rules Corrected:** Updated `scripts/doc-lint-rules.yml` with a comprehensive set of initial rules. Corrected a flawed rule regarding the `HANDOVER_BRIEF.md` to use the new `forbidden_docs` feature, correctly classifying it as a static document.
    7.  **Verification:**
        - Fixed multiple issues in the test environment (`APP_ENV` not set, missing `storage` directory) to get the `pytest` suite (`run_lint.sh`) to pass.
        - Ran `mkdocs build` successfully after populating `mkdocs.yml` with a valid configuration.
        - **Note:** The `lint-docs.py` script itself could not be fully tested due to a persistent environmental issue where `git` does not track file changes. The logic was implemented and improved, but the final verification was skipped.
*   **Outcome:** All tooling and configuration for the new automated documentation workflow has been implemented. The project now has a powerful, configurable system for ensuring documentation quality and consistency.
