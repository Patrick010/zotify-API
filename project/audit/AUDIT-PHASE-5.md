### Task: Implement Advanced Conditional Documentation Linter

*   **Reason & Goal:** To enhance the `scripts/lint-docs.py` to support a decision matrix that maps code changes to specific required documentation updates. This will enforce documentation-as-code policies more precisely than the current generic linter. This is the first task of Phase 5.
*   **Status:** üìù In Progress
*   **Summary of Activities:**
    *   [ ] Create `lint-rules.yml` to store the conditional rules.
    *   [ ] Update `scripts/lint-docs.py` to parse the YAML file and enforce the new rules.
    *   [ ] Implement a proof-of-concept with three initial rules.
    *   [ ] Manually test the new linter to ensure it functions as expected.
*   **Outcome:** TBD.
*   **NOTE:** The git environment is persistently corrupted, preventing proper integration testing. A workaround involving reading changed files from a text file will be used to test the core linter logic. The final submission will be made with the expectation that the script works, but this could not be fully verified in the provided environment.
