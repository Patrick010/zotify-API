# Phased Execution Plan for Aligning HLD/LLD with Roadmap and Codebase

## Phase 1: Prepare & Analyze (1–2 days)

**Goal:** Get a clear picture of where the gaps and misalignments are.

- **Task 1.1:** ✅ Done - Create a simple comparison spreadsheet (traceability matrix) listing all key features/components from HLD/LLD versus the roadmap and codebase.
  - Columns: Feature | Exists in Codebase? (Y/N) | Matches Design? (Y/N) | Notes on Deviations
- **Task 1.2:** ✅ Done - Review the roadmap and execution plan to identify core functionalities currently implemented.
- **Task 1.3:** ✅ Done - Collect input from devs and auditors about known design vs code mismatches.

## Phase 2: Document Deviations (2–3 days)

**Goal:** Record and explain every gap or deviation clearly for context.
**Status:** ✅ Done

- **Task 2.1:** ✅ Done - For each mismatch in the spreadsheet, add a brief note explaining why it exists (e.g., intentional change, technical debt, scope creep).
- **Task 2.2:** ✅ Done - Highlight which mismatches require fixing vs which are acceptable tradeoffs for now.
- **Task 2.3:** ✅ Done - Store this annotated matrix as the “alignment blueprint” in `docs/projectplan/audit/AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`.

## Phase 3: Implementation & Alignment (Ongoing, sprint-based)

**Goal:** Gradually resolve gaps from the traceability matrix by implementing missing features and aligning documentation with the code reality. The end state for any task in this phase is that the corresponding matrix row shows `Exists? = Y` and `Matches Design? = Y`.
**Status:** Ongoing

### Core Principle: The Two-Way Street
Alignment is a two-way street. Sometimes code must move to meet design, and sometimes design must move to meet code. The result must always be that the matrix, design, and code are in sync.

### Alignment Workflow
For each item selected from the `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`:

1.  **If a design feature is missing in the code (`Exists? = N`):**
    *   If the feature is still in the current project scope, **implement it**.
    *   If the feature is no longer in scope, **update the design documents** to mark it as deferred or cut.
2.  **If a code feature is missing in the design:**
    *   **Update the HLD/LLD** to include and describe the feature. Note in the matrix whether it’s intentional, technical debt, or a scope creep that got absorbed.
3.  **If code and design differ (mismatch):**
    *   If the code is correct, **update the design** to reflect it.
    *   If the code is wrong, **refactor the code** to match the design.
4.  **N/N (Not in Codebase, Not in Design, but appears in Roadmap/Scope/Future Enhancements):**
    *   → Clarify scope. If still valid: implement in code and document it. If no longer valid: mark it explicitly as “dropped requirement” in design/docs and update the matrix accordingly.

### Repeatable Task Cycle
- **Task 3.1:** Pick 1–2 core subsystems from the matrix with the biggest deviations.
- **Task 3.2:** Apply the Alignment Workflow above to the selected subsystem(s).
- **Task 3.3:** Link updated design sections and code changes back to relevant roadmap/execution plan steps.
- **Task 3.4:** Submit these as separate PRs for incremental review and merge.
- **Task 3.5:** Repeat this cycle for the next prioritized subsystems until full alignment is achieved.

## Phase 4: Enforce & Automate (Post-alignment)

**Goal:** Prevent future drift and keep design docs up to date.

- **Task 4.1:** Add doc update steps to the Task Execution Checklist as mandatory for all code PRs.
- **Task 4.2:** Implement a simple CI check (could be a checklist or script) to verify that related docs are updated before merge.
- **Task 4.3:** Schedule quarterly or sprint-end reviews for design docs to catch and fix drifts early.
- **Task 4.4:** Execute the detailed action plan for code optimization and quality assurance as defined in the [`CODE_OPTIMIZATIONPLAN_PHASE_4.md`](./CODE_OPTIMIZATIONPLAN_PHASE_4.md) document. This includes remediating technical debt and implementing the "Super-Lint" quality gates.

## Phase 5: Ongoing Maintenance

- **Task 5.1:** Use audit findings as triggers for spot updates in design docs.
- **Task 5.2:** Keep the alignment matrix updated as a living artifact.
- **Task 5.3:** Continue incremental updates as new features or refactors happen.
