# Phased Execution Plan for Aligning HLD/LLD with Roadmap and Codebase

## Phase 1: Prepare & Analyze (1–2 days)

**Goal:** Get a clear picture of where the gaps and misalignments are.
**Status:** ✅ Done

- **Task 1.1:** ✅ Done - Create a simple comparison spreadsheet (traceability matrix) listing all key features/components from HLD/LLD versus the roadmap and codebase.
  - Columns: Feature | Exists in Codebase? (Y/N) | Matches Design? (Y/N) | Notes on Deviations
- **Task 1.2:** ✅ Done - Review the roadmap and execution plan to identify core functionalities currently implemented.
- **Task 1.3:** ✅ Done - Collect input from devs and auditors about known design vs code mismatches.

## Phase 2: Document Deviations (2–3 days)

**Goal:** Record and explain every gap or deviation clearly for context.
**Status:** ✅ Done

- **Task 2.1:** ✅ Done - For each mismatch in the spreadsheet, add a brief note explaining why it exists (e.g., intentional change, technical debt, scope creep).
- **Task 2.2:** ✅ Done - Highlight which mismatches require fixing vs which are acceptable tradeoffs for now.
- **Task 2.3:** ✅ Done - Store this annotated matrix as the “alignment blueprint” in `docs/projectplan/audit/AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`.

## Phase 3: Incremental Design Updates (Ongoing, sprint-based)

**Goal:** Gradually update design docs to reflect reality, starting with critical subsystems.
**Status:** ✅ Done

- **Task 3.1:** Pick 1–2 core subsystems from the matrix with the biggest deviations.
- **Task 3.2:** Update the HLD and LLD sections for those subsystems:
  - Adjust descriptions and diagrams to match code.
  - Add notes explaining any intentional design decisions preserved.
- **Task 3.3:** Link updated design sections back to relevant roadmap/execution plan steps.
- **Task 3.4:** Submit these as separate PRs for incremental review and merge.
- **Task 3.5:** Repeat this cycle for next prioritized subsystems until full alignment.

## Phase 4: Enforce & Automate (Post-alignment)

**Goal:** Prevent future drift and keep design docs up to date.
**Status:** ❌ Not Started

- **Task 4.1:** Add doc update steps to the Task Execution Checklist as mandatory for all code PRs.
- **Task 4.2:** Implement a simple CI check (could be a checklist or script) to verify that related docs are updated before merge.
- **Task 4.3:** Schedule quarterly or sprint-end reviews for design docs to catch and fix drifts early.

## Phase 5: Ongoing Maintenance

**Status:** ❌ Not Started

- **Task 5.1:** Use audit findings as triggers for spot updates in design docs.
- **Task 5.2:** Keep the alignment matrix updated as a living artifact.
- **Task 5.3:** Continue incremental updates as new features or refactors happen.
