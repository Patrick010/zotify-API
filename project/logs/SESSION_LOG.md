## Session Report: 2025-08-29

**Summary:** Completed the implementation and correction of the Phase 5 Automated Documentation Workflow. This involved creating new tooling (`log-work.py`, `lint-docs.py`), integrating a documentation site generator (`mkdocs`), and fixing multiple issues in the test environment. The work was iterative and involved incorporating significant user feedback to correctly align the implementation with the project's logging philosophy.

**Findings:**
- The test environment was unstable and required fixes for `APP_ENV` and missing directories.
- The `git` status tracking in the sandbox environment is unreliable, which prevents the `lint-docs.py` script from running automatically. This was documented in the audit report.
- The initial implementation of `log-work.py` was based on a misunderstanding of the logging file purposes, which was corrected after user feedback.

**Outcome:**
- A new, more robust `log-work.py` script has been implemented.
- The `lint-docs.py` script has been enhanced with a `forbidden_docs` feature.
- The purpose of the Trinity logs has been clarified in `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`.
- All work is complete and verified (to the extent possible given the environment).

## Session Report: 2025-08-28

**Summary:** Performed a wide-ranging series of tasks to improve the project's organization, documentation, and quality assurance framework. This session addressed significant repository clutter and established new, sustainable processes for tracking and improving code quality.

**Findings:**
- The repository was cluttered with scripts and miscellaneous files in the root directory.
- The project lacked a formal, enforceable system for tracking and improving code quality.

**Outcome:**
- The repository has been significantly reorganized.
- A new Code Quality Index framework has been implemented across all three modules.
- A "gold standard" documentation example was created.
- The core execution plan was updated to include a formal "Code QA" step.
