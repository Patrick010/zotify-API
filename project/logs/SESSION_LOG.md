## Session Report: 2025-09-01 (Addendum 2)

**Summary:** This session was to correct a second process error from a previous commit. The creation of the `PROJECT_PLAN.md` was committed without first updating the Trinity logs.

**Findings:**
- A new `PROJECT_PLAN.md` was created to serve as a central execution reference for the project.
- The `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` was updated to include this new document.

**Outcome:**
- A new entry for this change was added to `ACTIVITY.md`.
- This `SESSION_LOG.md` and the `CURRENT_STATE.md` have been updated to reflect this work, bringing all logs into compliance with project standards.
---
## Session Report: 2025-09-01 (Addendum)

**Summary:** This brief session was to correct a process error from a previous commit. An update to `AGENTS.md` was committed without first updating the Trinity logs.

**Findings:**
- The `AGENTS.md` file was updated to clarify the manual execution policy for the `log-work.py` script.
- The example command for the script was also corrected to reflect its actual arguments.

**Outcome:**
- A new entry for this change was added to `ACTIVITY.md`.
- This `SESSION_LOG.md` and the `CURRENT_STATE.md` have been updated to reflect this work, bringing all logs into compliance with project standards.
---
## Session Report: 2025-09-01

**Summary:** This session focused on executing the "Archive Cleanup & Documentation Consolidation" task from the project roadmap. This involved a deep review of all archived documentation, deleting obsolete files, migrating valuable content, and addressing a newly discovered documentation gap.

**Findings:**
- A comprehensive review of the `project/archive/` directory was completed.
- The vast majority of archived files (~20) were found to be obsolete, inaccurate, or superseded and were deleted.
- Valuable historical information was identified in the archived `CHANGELOG.md`, `MANUAL.md`, and `security.md`. This content was migrated into the current, authoritative documentation to preserve project knowledge.
- A new documentation gap was discovered: the `PRIVACY_COMPLIANCE.md` file incorrectly stated that GDPR data export/deletion endpoints existed.
- Per user feedback, this gap was addressed by:
    1. Correcting the `PRIVACY_COMPLIANCE.md` to state the feature is "planned".
    2. Updating the `HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` and `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` with the design for the new privacy endpoints.
    3. Updating the `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` and `BACKLOG.md` to formally track the new feature.

**Outcome:**
- The project's documentation is now significantly cleaner, more accurate, and more consolidated.
- Obsolete files that caused confusion have been removed.
- Key historical and security context has been integrated into the living documentation.
- A plan for the future implementation of GDPR compliance endpoints is now formally tracked.

## Session Report: 2025-08-31

**Summary:** This session focused on correctly configuring the `mkdocs` build system, resolving all associated build errors and regressions, and bringing the project's "Living Documentation" up to date.

**Findings:**
- The task was initially confusing due to a series of conflicting user instructions regarding which documentation sets to include.
- The final, correct requirement was established: include `api/`, `snitch/`, and `gonk-testUI/` documentation while explicitly excluding `project/`.
- The `mkdocs-monorepo-plugin` was successfully implemented to achieve this multi-repository documentation build.
- A recurring `FileExistsError` during the build process was diagnosed by the user as being caused by leftover symlinks. After the user removed these, the build was successful. My own debugging attempts were incorrect and were reverted.
- A `TypeError` regression (`object dict can't be used in 'await' expression`) in the Spotify authentication callback was identified and fixed. This was caused by previous repository resets and was resolved by removing an erroneous `await` keyword in `spotify_connector.py` and correcting the associated unit test.

**Outcome:**
- The documentation build is now clean, correct, and warning-free.
- The Spotify authentication flow is fully functional.
- All three "Trinity" log files (`ACTIVITY.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md`) have been manually updated to accurately reflect all work performed during this session.
- The project is in a stable, verified, and correctly documented state, ready for submission.
---
## Session Report: 2025-08-31

**Summary:** This session focused on correctly configuring the `mkdocs` build system to create a unified documentation site and resolving all associated build errors.

**Findings:**
- The task was initially confusing due to a series of conflicting user instructions regarding which documentation sets to include.
- The final, correct requirement was to include `api/`, `snitch/`, and `gonk-testUI/` documentation while excluding `project/`.
- The `mkdocs-monorepo-plugin` was implemented to achieve this.
- A recurring `FileExistsError` bug was discovered during the build process. This was ultimately diagnosed by the user as being caused by leftover symlinks. After the user removed these, the build was successful. My own debugging attempts (renaming site_name, modifying nav) were incorrect and have been reverted.

**Outcome:**
- The documentation build is now clean, warning-free, and correctly configured to match the project's requirements.
- All three "Trinity" log files have been manually updated to reflect this work.

---
## Session Report: 2025-08-31

**Summary:** This session focused on correctly configuring the `mkdocs` build system. After a series of confusing and contradictory instructions, the final, correct requirement was established: to build a unified documentation site from the `api`, `snitch`, and `gonk-testUI` modules, while explicitly excluding the `project` module.

**Findings:**
- The initial goal, derived from the `HANDOVER_BRIEF.md`, was to include all project documentation. This was later contradicted by user feedback, leading to several course corrections.
- The final, correct implementation uses the `mkdocs-monorepo-plugin` to combine the documentation sets.
- All documentation build warnings were resolved.

**Outcome:**
- The documentation build is now clean and correctly configured to match the project's requirements.
- The "Trinity" log files have been manually updated to reflect this work, as per the Living Documentation policy.

---
## Session Report: 2025-08-31

**Summary:** Finally resolved all mkdocs build warnings. The solution was to add a comprehensive nav section to mkdocs.yml, which explicitly defines the set of documents to be included in the site. This prevents mkdocs from discovering and parsing other files with broken or cross-directory links.
**Findings:**
- (To be filled in manually)

---
## Session Report: 2025-08-31

**Summary:** Methodically fixed all mkdocs build warnings by correcting relative paths and removing invalid links. Also fixed the start.sh script to ensure dependencies are installed correctly. The documentation now builds cleanly and the application starts as expected.

---
## Session Report: 2025-08-31

**Summary:** After a great deal of confusion caused by a repository reset, a final mkdocs build command was run at the user's request. The build completed with no warnings, confirming that the documentation is in a correct state. All other outstanding issues were also found to be already resolved.
**Findings:**
- (To be filled in manually)

---
## Session Report: 2025-08-31

**Summary:** The user instructed to delete the MODULE_REGISTRY.md file that I had created by renaming REGISTRY.md. After a repository reset, this file no longer existed, so the instruction was fulfilled by the state of the repository.
**Findings:**
- (To be filled in manually)

---

**Summary:** After a series of confusing steps and a repository reset, a full verification was performed. The application startup error is fixed. The start.sh script is correct. The documentation builds without any warnings. The repository is in a clean and correct state, ready for submission.
**Findings:**
- (To be filled in manually)

---
## Session Report: 2025-08-31

**Summary:** Resolved all mkdocs build warnings. The primary fix was to add an explicit nav section to mkdocs.yml to control which files are included in the build. A cross-directory link was fixed by using a pymdownx.snippets inclusion, and another broken link was fixed by correcting its case.
**Findings:**
- (To be filled in manually)

---
## Session Report: 2025-08-31

**Summary:** Resolved a fatal application startup error caused by the logging framework's inability to find its configuration file. The file loading logic in main.py and system.py was patched to use absolute paths, making the application robust to the launch directory.

- (To be filled in manually)

---
## Session Report: 2025-08-31

**Summary:** Completed a major overhaul of the documentation process and linter enforcement. Renamed documentation files, created a new master index, updated project policies, and implemented new linter logic for convention-based checking of existing and new files.
**Findings:**
- (To be filled in manually)

---
## Session Report: 2025-08-30

**Summary:** Performed final corrections to the documentation workflow and project logs. This included updating developer guides to reflect the new tooling and ensuring all log files are consistent and correctly formatted according to the project's standards.

**Findings:**
- The `log-work.py` script was not being used correctly to specify which files were changed. This has been corrected.
- The `ACTIVITY.md` and `SESSION_LOG.md` files had been polluted with duplicate and malformed entries from previous failed script runs. These have been cleaned up.

**Outcome:**
- The project logs are now clean and accurate.
- The developer documentation is consistent with the new workflow.
- The project is now in a fully consistent and correct state, ready for submission.

---
## Session Report: 2025-08-29

**Summary:** Restored the session log after it was accidentally deleted during a previous, flawed correction attempt.

**Findings:**
- A `restore_file` operation was necessary to recover the lost history of the session log.

**Outcome:**
- The `SESSION_LOG.md` file has been restored to its correct state, preserving the project's history.

---
## Session Report: 2025-08-29

**Summary:** Refactored the logging system based on user feedback to correctly handle the distinct purpose of each log file. This included redesigning the `log-work.py` script and clarifying the `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`.

**Findings:**
- The initial `log-work.py` script was too simplistic and did not differentiate between log types.
- The `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` lacked specific definitions for the log files.

**Outcome:**
- A new, more robust `log-work.py` script was implemented with specific arguments for each log type.
- The project registry was updated with clear definitions for all three "Trinity" logs.

---
## Session Report: 2025-08-29

**Summary:** Completed the initial implementation of the Phase 5 Automated Documentation Workflow, creating scripts and adding dependencies.

**Findings:**
- The test environment was unstable, requiring fixes to `run_lint.sh`.
- The `mkdocs.yml` file required a valid configuration to build.
- A rule in `doc-lint-rules.yml` was flawed and needed correction based on user feedback.

**Outcome:**
- The test environment is now stable.
- The `mkdocs` build is successful.
- The linter rules have been improved.

---

### 2025-08-18: Design of Plugin-Driven Metadata System

**Audit Finding:**
A new major feature, the Plugin-Driven Multi-Source Metadata System, was proposed and designed.

**Verification Activities:**
- A new proposal document, `MULTI_SOURCE_METADATA_PROPOSAL.md`, was created.
- The proposal was integrated into the project's living documentation by updating `FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`, `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`, and `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`.

**Conclusion:**
The design task is complete. The new proposed architecture is fully documented and tracked in accordance with project standards, ready for future implementation.

---

### 2025-08-18: Post-Verification Hardening

**Audit Finding:**
Following the initial successful verification of the project documentation, a full run of the test suite was initiated as a final quality gate. This uncovered several latent bugs that were not apparent from the documentation or previous test runs.

**Issues Discovered and Resolved:**
1.  **Latent Unit Test Bugs:** A full `pytest` run revealed several failures in `api/tests/unit/test_auth.py`. These were caused by incorrect mocks (synchronous mocks for async calls), incomplete mock objects, incorrect test assertions, and a logic bug in the `get_auth_status` service itself. All failing tests were repaired.
2.  **Runtime `TypeError`:** Subsequent manual testing revealed a `TypeError` on the `/api/auth/status` endpoint. This was traced to an unsafe comparison between a timezone-naive datetime from the database and a timezone-aware `datetime`. A fix was implemented in the `get_auth_status` service to make the comparison robust.

**Conclusion:**
The discovery and resolution of these issues have significantly hardened the stability and reliability of the codebase beyond the state described in the initial handover. The entire test suite (139 tests) is now confirmed to be passing.

---

### 2025-08-18: Independent Verification by New Developer

**Audit Task:**
As per the handover brief and onboarding instructions, perform an independent verification of the project's state. The goal is to confirm that the key "source of truth" documents (`CURRENT_STATE.md`, `ACTIVITY.md`, and `AUDIT-PHASE-4.md`) accurately reflect the state of the codebase.

**Verification Activities & Findings:**
A series of spot-checks were performed against the claims made in the documentation:

1.  **`snitch` Application Refactoring:**
    *   **Action:** Inspected the `snitch/` directory.
    *   **Finding:** Confirmed that the application was refactored into a single `snitch.go` file and the legacy `cmd/` and `internal/` directories were removed. **Status: Verified.**

2.  **Logging Framework Hardening:**
    *   **Action:** Inspected `api/logging_framework.yml`.
    *   **Finding:** Confirmed the presence of the `security_log` sink and the "security" tag trigger for routing. **Status: Verified.**
    -   **Action:** Inspected `api/src/zotify_api/core/logging_framework/filters.py`.
    *   **Finding:** Confirmed the existence and correct redaction logic of the `SensitiveDataFilter`. **Status: Verified.**
    *   **Action:** Inspected `api/src/zotify_api/routes/auth.py`.
    *   **Finding:** Confirmed that both successful and failed authentication attempts are logged with the "security" tag. **Status: Verified.**

3.  **New Architectural Proposals:**
    *   **Action:** Listed the contents of the `project/` directory.
    *   **Finding:** Confirmed the existence of `DYNAMIC_PLUGIN_PROPOSAL.md`, `LOW_CODE_PROPOSAL.md`, and `HOME_AUTOMATION_PROPOSAL.md`. **Status: Verified.**

**Conclusion:**
The project's key documentation is verified to be an accurate and reliable reflection of the codebase. The project is in a stable state, and the handover information is confirmed to be correct.

---

### 2025-08-18: Independent Verification (Session Start)

**Audit Finding:**
As per the onboarding instructions, an independent verification was performed to ensure the project's key documentation (`CURRENT_STATE.md`, `ACTIVITY.md`, `AUDIT-PHASE-4.md`) accurately reflects the state of the codebase.

**Verification Activities:**
1.  **`CURRENT_STATE.md` Correction:** The file was found to be out of sync with the latest project status. It was overwritten with the correct content provided during the session handover.
2.  **Documentation Spot-Checks:** A series of checks were performed against the claims made in `ACTIVITY.md` and `AUDIT-PHASE-4.md`.
    *   Confirmed the existence of the three new proposal documents: `DYNAMIC_PLUGIN_PROPOSAL.md`, `LOW_CODE_PROPOSAL.md`, and `HOME_AUTOMATION_PROPOSAL.md`.
    *   Confirmed the implementation of the "Flexible Logging Framework Hardening":
        *   The `api/logging_framework.yml` file correctly defines the `security_log` sink and a "security" tag for routing.
        *   The `SensitiveDataFilter` exists in `api/src/zotify_api/core/logging_framework/filters.py` and contains the expected redaction logic.
    *   Confirmed the refactoring of the `snitch` application into a single `snitch.go` file.

**Conclusion:**
The project's key documentation is now verified to be an accurate reflection of the codebase. The project is in a stable state, ready for the next task.

# Audit Phase 4: Findings and Final Plan

### 2025-08-18: Final Strategic Proposals

**Audit Finding:**
Following the successful resolution of all outstanding bugs, a final strategic discussion was held to outline future architectural enhancements for the platform.

**Proposals Created:**
Two new formal proposal documents were created to capture the long-term vision for the platform's extensibility and accessibility:
1.  **`DYNAMIC_PLUGIN_PROPOSAL.md`**: This was updated to serve as the master proposal for a plugin architecture that will eventually supersede the current Provider Abstraction Layer. This is a key strategic shift for the platform.
2.  **`LOW_CODE_PROPOSAL.md`**: A new proposal was created to outline the vision for integrating the Zotify API with low-code/no-code platforms like Node-RED.
3.  **`HOME_AUTOMATION_PROPOSAL.md`**: A new proposal was created to outline the vision for integrating with home automation platforms like Home Assistant.

**Current Status:**
These proposals have been created and integrated into all high-level project documentation (`PID`, `HLD`, `LLD`, `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX`, etc.) to ensure they are tracked as official future enhancements. The project is now in a stable and fully documented state, ready for the next phase of work.

### 2025-08-18: Final Report on `snitch` Regression and Logging Framework Hardening

**Audit Finding:**
This work session began with a critical regression in the `snitch` helper application. The investigation and resolution of this issue uncovered a series of deeper architectural problems and led to a significant hardening of the new Flexible Logging Framework.

**Investigation and Resolution Summary:**
1.  **`snitch` Build Failure:** The initial problem was a persistent build failure. This was eventually traced to a structural conflict in the `snitch` Go module. The issue was resolved by refactoring `snitch` into a single, self-contained Go application, which eliminated the build ambiguity.
2.  **API `TypeError`:** The now-working `snitch` application revealed a latent `TypeError` in the API's `/auth/spotify/callback` endpoint, which was subsequently fixed.
3.  **Logging Framework Hardening:** Based on iterative user feedback, the logging framework was significantly enhanced:
    *   **Security Redaction:** A `SensitiveDataFilter` was implemented to automatically redact sensitive information from logs in production environments (`APP_ENV=production`).
    *   **Tag-Based Routing:** The trigger system was upgraded to support routing based on tags (e.g., a `"security"` tag), making the framework more flexible and configurable.
    *   **Comprehensive Audit Trail:** The system was updated to log both successful and failed authentication attempts to a dedicated `security.log`, providing a complete audit trail.

**Current Status:**
All identified bugs and regressions have been resolved. The `snitch` application is functional, and the logging framework is now more secure, flexible, and robust. The project is in a stable state.

**Recommendation:**
The recommendation to add an integration test for `snitch` to the CI/CD pipeline remains valid to prevent future regressions.

### 2025-08-17: API Canonicalization and `snitch` Regression

**Audit Finding:**
A major refactoring effort was undertaken to canonicalize the entire API. This successfully brought the API endpoints and response structures into a consistent, predictable standard, fulfilling a key goal of the "establish reality" audit. All API-level and project-level documentation was updated to reflect this new reality.

**Regression Introduced:**
The refactoring introduced a critical regression in the `snitch` helper application, breaking the CLI authentication flow. This demonstrates a gap in the project's testing strategy, as there were no automated tests covering the `snitch` tool's interaction with the API.

**Current Status:**
The `snitch` source code has been patched to align with the new API. However, a persistent and unresolved build issue is preventing the fix from being deployed.

**Recommendation:**
1.  The `snitch` build issue must be resolved as a high priority.
2.  A simple integration test should be added to the project's CI/CD pipeline to run `snitch.exe` against the live API to prevent similar regressions in the future.

This session focused on performing an independent verification of the project's state, as established by the previous developer's work. The goal was to "establish reality" by confirming that the codebase aligns with the extensive documentation overhaul that was recently completed.

---

## Session Report (2025-08-17): Independent Verification

### 1. Verification Activities

*   **Test Suite Execution:** The full test suite was executed according to the instructions in `api/docs/system/INSTALLATION.md`.
*   **Startup Script Verification:** The `scripts/start.sh` script was executed to ensure the API server starts correctly.
*   **Code and Documentation Spot-Checks:** A series of targeted checks were performed to verify key integrations and refactorings described in the project's "living documentation" (`ACTIVITY.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, etc.).

### 2. Findings

The verification was successful. The project is stable and the documentation is a reliable reflection of the codebase.

*   **Test Suite:** All **133 tests passed** successfully.
    *   This confirms the stability of the test environment.
    *   This count aligns with `CURRENT_STATE.md`. The mention of 135 tests in a previous audit report appears to be a minor historical inaccuracy.
    *   A total of 42 warnings were observed, primarily related to the use of deprecated libraries. These do not affect functionality but have been noted as minor technical debt.
*   **Startup Script:** The `scripts/start.sh` script was confirmed to be working correctly, successfully installing dependencies and launching the server.
*   **Code/Doc Alignment:** All spot-checks passed.
    *   The `LoggingService` is correctly integrated into the application startup sequence in `main.py`.
    *   The `ENDPOINTS.md` file is comprehensive and well-structured, supporting the claim of its generation from the OpenAPI schema.
    *   The `error_handler` in `triggers.py` was confirmed to be refactored to dynamically load actions.
    *   Newly created documents, such as the flexible logging framework design, were found in their correct locations.

### 3. Conclusion

The project's state is verified and confirmed to be stable. The documentation is accurate and can be trusted as the single source of truth for future development. No corrective actions are required.

**Addendum:** A final documentation refactoring was performed to centralize the logging framework's phased implementation plan into a new `LOGGING_PHASES.md` document, further improving organization.

---

This document summarizes the findings from the code audit and test suite restoration.

## 1. Findings

*   **Outdated Documentation:** Project status documents were inaccurate. The "Generic Error Handling Module" was found to be fully implemented, contrary to the documentation.
*   **Broken Test Suite:** The test suite was non-functional due to environment, configuration, and obsolete code issues.
*   **Code-Level Bugs:** After repairing the test suite, 50 test failures were identified and fixed. Key issues included:
    *   Database initialization errors.
    *   Poor test isolation practices (improper use of `dependency_overrides.clear()`).
    *   Missing mocks for external services, causing unintended network calls.
    *   A bug in the error handler's singleton implementation.

## 2. Outcome

The project is now in a stable state with a fully passing test suite (135/135 tests).

## 3. Proposed Next Steps

*   Complete the partial webhook implementation.
*   Refactor the provider abstraction to remove a temporary hack.
*   Update all project documentation to reflect the current state of the code.

---

## 4. Session Report (2025-08-17): Final Documentation Overhaul & Correction

This session focused on resolving all remaining documentation gaps and ensuring the project's documentation is fully aligned with the codebase.

### 4.1 Master Endpoint Reference
- A new canonical endpoint reference, `project/ENDPOINTS.md`, was created and then completely rewritten using data generated from the application's OpenAPI schema to ensure its accuracy and completeness.

### 4.2 Documentation Restoration
- Several critical documents (`full_api_reference.md`, `PRIVACY_COMPLIANCE.md`, `phase5-ipc.md`) were restored from the project archive and placed in their correct locations.
- The `project/ENDPOINTS.md` file was updated to link to these restored documents.

### 4.3 Project Registry Audit
- A full audit of the `project/PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` file was conducted.
- The registry was updated to include all markdown documents for the `api`, `snitch`, and `gonk-testUI` modules, as well as all critical project-level and audit-level documents. The registry is now considered complete and accurate.

---

## 5. Addendum (2025-08-17): Post-Integration Verification

This section serves as a correction to the findings listed in the "Audit Verification and Backlog Formalization" session report below.

### 5.1 Correction of Previous Audit Findings

A deeper investigation was conducted as part of the work for `LOG-TASK-01`. This investigation revealed that the initial "Audit Verification" was based on incomplete information.

-   **Logging System:** The finding that the logging system was a "placeholder" is **incorrect**. A thorough code review found that all major components of the new logging system (including the `LoggingService`, all three handlers, the `JobLog` database model, the YAML configuration, and a full suite of unit tests) were already fully implemented in the codebase. The task, therefore, shifted from "implementation" to "integration and verification." The system has now been successfully integrated into the application's startup lifecycle.

---

## 6. Session Report (2025-08-17): Audit Verification and Backlog Formalization

This session focused on verifying the audit findings from the developer brief and formalizing the project's next steps in the backlog.

### 6.1 Audit Verification
A deep verification of the audit findings was performed to "establish reality" before proceeding with the main execution plan.
- **Logging System:** Confirmed that the implementation in `api/src/zotify_api/services/logging_service.py` is a placeholder and does not match the approved design. **Finding is correct.**  *(Note: This finding was later corrected in the Addendum above).*
- **Error Handling Module:** Confirmed that the module is fully implemented in `api/src/zotify_api/core/error_handler/` and that the statement in `project/ACTIVITY.md` about the implementation being "lost" is incorrect. **Finding is correct.**
- **Test Suite Environment:** Confirmed that the test suite is broken out-of-the-box. It requires the manual, undocumented steps of creating `api/storage` and setting the environment variable `APP_ENV=development` to pass. After performing these steps, all 135 tests passed successfully. **Finding is correct.**

### 6.2 Backlog Formalization
- **`BACKLOG.md`:** Updated to remove obsolete `LOG-TASK-` entries from the previous design phase.
- Two new, high-priority tasks were added to drive the next phase of work:
    - `REM-TASK-01`: To perform documentation/environment remediation.
    - `LOG-TASK-01`: To implement the new logging system.

### 6.3 Environment and Documentation Remediation
- The `.gitignore` file was updated to ignore the `api/storage` directory and local database files.
- The `INSTALLATION.md` guide was updated to include the missing manual setup steps required to run the test suite.
- The `ACTIVITY.md` log was corrected to accurately reflect the status of the Error Handling Module.

### 6.4 Error Handler Refactoring
- The `TriggerManager` was refactored to support pluggable, dynamically loaded actions.
- The `ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md` was updated to reflect the new, simpler process for adding actions.
- All unit tests were confirmed to pass after the refactoring.

---

## 7. Session Report (2025-08-15): Documentation and Process Hardening

This session focused on interpreting and strengthening the project's documentation and development processes.

### 7.1 Documentation Policy Interpretation
- A deep dive was conducted into the project's documentation policies by analyzing `PID.md`, `HLD.md`, `LLD.md`, and the audit trail.
- The core policy was identified as "living documentation," requiring docs to be updated in lock-step with code.
- Key enforcement gaps were identified, such as the missing `TASK_CHECKLIST.md`.

### 7.2 Process Implementation: Task Backlog Mechanism
A new, a formal "Task Backlog Mechanism" was implemented to enforce stricter process discipline.
- **`BACKLOG.md`:** Overwritten with a new structured template, requiring tasks to have a source, a acceptance criteria, dependencies, etc.
- **`PID.md`:** Updated to formally document the new rules for backlog management and task qualification.
- **`TASK_CHECKLIST.md`:** Updated with a new mandatory "Task Qualification" step, requiring developers to manually verify a task's readiness against the new rules before starting work.
- **`PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`:** Updated to reflect the new, more formal backlog process.

### 7.3 Documentation Cleanup
- The missing `TASK_CHECKLIST.md` was located in the `project/archive` and restored to `project/`.
- The outdated, hardcoded file list within `TASK_CHECKLIST.md` was removed and replaced with a reference to the `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`.
