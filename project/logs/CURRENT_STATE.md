Project State as of 2025-08-19

Status: Live Document

1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session focused on correcting and clarifying the project's core process documentation to ensure all future development work is unambiguous.

*   **Phase 3 Guidance Corrected and Clarified:** The `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md` was updated to correct the status of Phase 3 to "Ongoing". More importantly, the vague task list was replaced with a crystal-clear, algorithmic rule set that explicitly defines the implementation and documentation work required to close gaps from the traceability matrix.

*   **Onboarding and Process Documents Enhanced:** The `TASK_CHECKLIST.md` was restructured to be more efficient and its mandatory nature was emphasized in the `ONBOARDING.md` file to prevent future process misinterpretations.

2. Known Issues & Blockers

There are no known bugs, regressions, or blockers. The project's core processes are now more robustly documented.

3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The project is now correctly set up to begin the **Implementation & Alignment** phase. The next step is to create a new plan to address the first item from the `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`, which is the `JWT for API Authentication` task. This will involve reverting the previous flawed attempt and performing a proper, implementation-focused task.
