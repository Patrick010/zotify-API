# Project State as of 2025-08-23

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session successfully completed a major technical debt remediation task: the full, strict `mypy` static analysis of the entire `api` module. This has significantly improved the robustness, maintainability, and reliability of the codebase.

*   **`mypy` Remediation Complete:** The entire `api` module, including all application source code (`api/src`) and the test suite (`api/tests`), now passes a `mypy --strict` check with zero errors.
*   **SQLAlchemy 2.0 Refactor:** All database models were migrated to the modern SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM syntax to ensure compatibility with the `mypy` plugin and to follow current best practices.
*   **Test Suite Stabilized:** The process of adding types and running tests uncovered and led to the resolution of numerous latent bugs. The full `pytest` suite of 201 tests is now 100% passing.
*   **Production Bugs Fixed:** Several runtime bugs in the API that were not caught by the existing tests were discovered and fixed, including incorrect endpoint signatures and `async/await` misuse.
*   **Developer Documentation Enhanced:** The `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` has been updated with comprehensive instructions on how to run the static analysis and testing tools, which will aid future contributors.
*   **Project Logs Updated:** All relevant project management and audit logs (`ACTIVITY.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md`, `AUDIT-PHASE-4.md`, etc.) have been updated to reflect the completion of this task.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers

*   There are no known blockers. The project is in a stable, verified state.

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

*   The work for this session is complete. The next steps will be determined by the project plan, likely focusing on the remaining tasks in **Phase 4: Enforce & Automate**.
