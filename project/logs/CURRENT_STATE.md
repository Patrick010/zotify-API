Status: Live Document

1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session successfully completed two major project goals:

*   **Test Coverage Increased to >90%:** The total test coverage for the API was increased from 83% to **90.01%**. This was achieved by adding over 60 new unit tests. The entire test suite of 201 tests is now passing.

*   **Phase 3 (Implementation & Alignment) Completed:** A full review of the `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` was conducted. It was confirmed that all active, non-deferred implementation tasks are complete. The project's documentation now accurately reflects the state of the codebase.

*   **CI Coverage Gate Implemented:** A new GitHub Actions workflow was created at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to enforce a test coverage minimum of 85% on all future pull requests.

2. Known Issues & Blockers

There are no known bugs, regressions, or blockers. The project is in a stable state, ready to move to the next phase.

3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

With Phase 3 complete, the project is now ready to begin **Phase 4: Enforce & Automate**. The next task will be to review and execute the plan outlined in `project/audit/CODE_OPTIMIZATIONPLAN_PHASE_4.md`.
