1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session initiated **Phase 4a: Technical Debt Remediation**. The primary goal is to establish a clean baseline by integrating a suite of static analysis tools.

*   **Tooling Setup:** Created baseline configurations for `ruff` (linter), `mypy` (type checking), and `golangci-lint` (Go linter).
*   **Initial Remediation:**
    *   Resolved `mypy` module name conflicts.
    *   Ran a `bandit` security scan and mitigated one medium-severity issue.
    *   Ran `ruff check . --fix` to auto-correct linting issues.

2. Known Issues & Blockers

*   **Ruff Configuration Issue:** Progress is currently **blocked**. The `ruff` linter is not functioning correctly due to a suspected misconfiguration in the root `pyproject.toml`. The tool reports errors with incorrect file paths (pointing to a non-existent `src/` directory instead of `api/src/`), which prevents manual remediation of the 213 remaining linting errors.

3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

*   **Resolve Blocker:** The immediate next step is to diagnose and fix the `ruff` configuration by correcting the path in `pyproject.toml`.
*   **Remediate Linting:** Once `ruff` is working, the remaining 213 linting errors must be fixed.
*   **Complete Baseline Verification:** Run the full suite of tools (`mypy`, `bandit`, `safety`, `golangci-lint`) to ensure the codebase is clean before proceeding.
*   **Commit Work:** Per user instruction, all work from this session will be committed after documentation is updated.
