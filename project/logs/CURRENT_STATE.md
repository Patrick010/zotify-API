# Project State as of 2025-09-01

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments
- **Archive Cleanup & Documentation Consolidation:** A major documentation task was completed, including deleting obsolete files, migrating valuable content, and designing a new GDPR feature.
- **Process Documentation Update:** The `AGENTS.md` file was updated to clarify the manual execution policy for the `log-work.py` script, correcting a process knowledge gap.
- **Trinity Logs Synchronized:** All three Trinity log files have been updated to reflect the work of the current session.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers
- The `notifications` endpoints are known to be unauthenticated, as documented in `project/SECURITY.md`. This should be addressed when a full user authentication system is implemented.

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps
- The project's documentation and backlog are now in a clean and well-defined state. The next logical step is to begin work on one of the high-priority features from the backlog:
    - **`FEAT-PRIVACY-01`**: Implement the newly designed GDPR endpoints.
    - **`FEAT-SDK-01`**: Implement the dynamic plugin system for the logging framework.
