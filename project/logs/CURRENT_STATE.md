# Project State as of 2025-08-26

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session focused on completing the final implementation gaps and documentation consolidation for **Phase 4** of the HLD/LLD Alignment Plan. The "Super-Lint" initiative is now fully realized.

*   **Planning Document Consolidation:** The two parallel plans for Phase 4 (`HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md` and `CODE_OPTIMIZATIONPLAN_PHASE_4.md`) were reconciled. The `PHASE_4_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` was rewritten to serve as a "glue" document linking the high-level phases to the detailed implementation tasks.
*   **`gosec` Linter Implemented:** The `gosec` security linter for Go was enabled in the `.golangci.yml` configuration, and the one reported issue in the `snitch` module was remediated.
*   **Documentation Linter Enhanced:** The `scripts/lint-docs.py` linter was enhanced with a new mandatory rule requiring the "Trinity" log files (`CURRENT_STATE.md`, `ACTIVITY.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md`) to be updated on every commit.
*   **Pre-commit Hooks Completed:** The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` was updated to include hooks for `ruff` and `golangci-lint`, in addition to the documentation linter.
*   **Code Review Process Formalized:** The `TASK_CHECKLIST.md` was updated with a new formal code review checklist and a scoring rubric.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers

There are **no known issues or blockers**. The project is in a highly stable state with a green CI pipeline and a comprehensive, fully-enforced set of automated quality gates. All work for Phase 4 is complete.

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The project is now ready to proceed to **Phase 5: Ongoing Maintenance**, or to begin a new phase of work implementing features from the `project/BACKLOG.md`.
