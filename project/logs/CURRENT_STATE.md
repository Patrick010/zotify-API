# Project State as of 2025-08-30

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

The automated documentation workflow and its associated tooling (`log-work.py`, `lint-docs.py`) are now fully implemented and corrected. All related documentation and project logs have been updated and are consistent.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers

- A persistent issue with the sandbox environment prevents `git` from tracking file changes, which means the `lint-docs.py` script cannot run automatically. This has been noted in the audit report for Phase 5.

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

- Final code review and submission of the new workflow tooling and all related corrections.
