# Project State as of 2025-08-31

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments
- The `mkdocs` build system has been reconfigured to use the `mkdocs-monorepo-plugin`.
- A recurring `FileExistsError` during the build was ultimately traced by the user to leftover symlinks in the repository. After these were removed, the build was successful.
- The documentation site now correctly builds a unified site from the `api/`, `snitch/`, and `gonk-testUI/` modules, while excluding the `project/` module.
- The repository is in a stable and verified state.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers
- None

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps
- (To be filled in manually)
