# Project State as of 2025-08-31

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments
- The `mkdocs` build system has been reconfigured to use the `mkdocs-monorepo-plugin`.
- A build issue with the plugin (`FileExistsError`) was debugged and resolved by renaming the `site_name` in `snitch/mkdocs.yml` to `snitch-docs`.
- The documentation site now correctly builds a unified site from the `api/`, `snitch/`, and `gonk-testUI/` modules.
- The `project/` module is correctly excluded from the documentation build.
- The documentation build is now clean and warning-free.
- The repository is in a stable and verified state.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers
