# Project State as of 2025-08-26

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session focused on resolving uncertainty surrounding the completion status of the project's "Phase 4c" and "Phase 4d" quality gates. An audit was performed to establish the "code reality" and align the project's living documentation.

*   **Audit Performed:** A detailed audit of the codebase and CI/CD configuration was conducted.
*   **Phase 4c Verified as Done:** The audit confirmed that the "Custom Architectural & Documentation Linter" is fully implemented. The linter script exists, is integrated into CI, and the related documentation was refactored.
*   **Phase 4d Verified as Partially Done:** The audit confirmed that the "Local Enforcement" using pre-commit hooks is fully implemented. However, the task to create a "formal code review checklist" in `TASK_CHECKLIST.md` remains outstanding.
*   **Living Documentation Aligned:** Key project documents, including `project/audit/HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md` and `project/audit/AUDIT-PHASE-4.md`, have been updated to reflect these findings, resolving previous documentation drift.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers

There are **no blocking issues**. However, there is one outstanding task required to fully complete Phase 4 of the alignment plan.

*   **Incomplete Task:** The `project/TASK_CHECKLIST.md` has not yet been updated with a formal, detailed checklist for conducting code reviews.

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The project is in a stable state. The next logical step is to complete the final remaining task of the "Enforce & Automate" phase.

*   **Complete Phase 4d:** Update `project/TASK_CHECKLIST.md` to include a formal code review checklist, as specified in the `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md`.
