Project State as of 2025-08-19

Status: Live Document

1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session was focused on a final, deep clarification of the project's core processes to ensure all future development work is unambiguous and efficient.

*   **Phase 3 Alignment Plan Finalized:** The `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md` was corrected and finalized. The status of Phase 3 is now correctly marked as "Ongoing", and the section contains a crystal-clear, algorithmic workflow and a concrete, repeatable task list. This resolves all prior ambiguity about the goals and execution of the project's main alignment phase.

*   **Onboarding and Process Documents Enhanced:** Previous work in this session improved the `TASK_CHECKLIST.md` and `ONBOARDING.md` to make the project's definition of "Done" and the required development processes clearer.

*   **JWT Feature Alignment:** The "JWT for API Authentication" feature was correctly aligned in the `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` to reflect its deferred status, pending promotion from the `FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md` document.

2. Known Issues & Blockers

There are no known bugs, regressions, or blockers. The project's core processes are now robustly documented and clear.

3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The project is now, finally, correctly set up to begin the **Implementation & Alignment** phase. The next step is to create a new plan to address the next actionable item from the `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`.
