Project State as of 2025-08-20

Status: Live Document

1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session has continued the work of the **Implementation & Alignment** phase. The primary focus is to systematically work through the `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` to ensure every item is correctly aligned with the codebase and design documents.

*   **Security Enhancements Feature Aligned:** The "Security Enhancements" feature (including secret rotation and TLS hardening) was correctly aligned in the `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`. Following the established process, the code was verified to confirm the feature is not yet implemented, and the design documents were verified to confirm it is tracked as a future enhancement. The matrix was updated to `N / Y (Deferred)`, reflecting this reality.

*   **Process Refinements:** Prior work in this session finalized and clarified the project's core processes, particularly the workflow for the Implementation & Alignment phase, ensuring all development is unambiguous and efficient.

2. Known Issues & Blockers

There are no known bugs, regressions, or blockers. The project's core processes are robustly documented and clear.

3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The project continues with the **Implementation & Alignment** phase. The next step is to create a new plan to address the next actionable item from the `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`.
