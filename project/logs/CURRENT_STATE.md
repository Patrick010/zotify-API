Project State as of 2025-08-19

Status: Live Document

1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session focused on a series of audits to verify and improve the project's "living documentation" and enforce its policies.

*   **Documentation Hardened:** The audit process uncovered and fixed several gaps in the project's documentation, improving its accuracy and usability for future developers.
    *   The `INSTALLATION.md` guide for the API was updated with critical, missing setup steps that previously caused the server to crash on startup.
    *   The documented API test count was corrected across `ACTIVITY.md` and `SESSION_LOG.md` to reflect the actual number of tests (139).

*   **Project Registry Corrected:** An audit of the `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` file was completed. It was synchronized with the filesystem by removing 4 entries for non-existent files and adding 2 newly discovered documentation files.

*   **Task Checklist Modernized:** The `TASK_CHECKLIST.md` was audited and found to be severely outdated. It has been corrected by removing obsolete instructions, updating all file paths to their current locations, and clarifying the documentation review process to reinforce the `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` as the single source of truth.

*   **Project State Verified:** The audits re-verified the stability of the codebase, the 100% passing test suite, and the successful completion of all work from the previous session.

2. Known Issues & Blockers

There are no known bugs, regressions, or blockers. The project is in a stable, verified state with a high degree of documentation accuracy and process alignment.

3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The project remains ready for the next major phase of development. Immediate next steps could focus on:

*   Implementing the new **Plugin-Driven Multi-Source Metadata System** as a proof-of-concept.
*   Implementing the **Dynamic Plugin System** for the logging framework as a proof-of-concept.
*   Beginning the comprehensive documentation quality upgrade by refactoring key manuals to the new, higher standard.
