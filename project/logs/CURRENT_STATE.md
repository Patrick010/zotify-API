# Project State as of 2025-08-22

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session completed the first stage of **Phase 4a: Technical Debt Remediation**.

*   **Linter Configuration Fixed:** Resolved a critical blocker by correcting the `ruff` linter's pathing configuration in `api/pyproject.toml`.
*   **Codebase Linting Complete:** The entire in-scope codebase has been formatted with `black` and all `ruff` linting errors have been remediated. The codebase is now clean from a linting perspective.
*   **Test Suite Stabilized:** The project's test suite is now stable. All 204 unit and integration tests pass reliably after fixing a `sqlite3.OperationalError` caused by a missing `api/storage` directory. The 4 failing functional tests are expected and documented.
*   **Out-of-Scope Code Removed:** The `zotify/` directory, which was confirmed to be out-of-scope, has been deleted to reduce project noise.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers

*   There are no known blockers at this time. The project is in a clean state, ready for the next task.

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

*   **Continue Phase 4a:** The next step is to proceed with the next task in the `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md`, which is to run the remaining static analysis tools (`mypy`, `bandit`, `golangci-lint`) and remediate their findings.
*   **Commit Work:** All work from this session will be committed on the `feature/lint-and-test-remediation` branch after this documentation is updated.
