Project State as of 2025-08-18

Status: Live Document
1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session included a wide range of activities, from bug fixing and test suite hardening to major new architectural design work.

*   **Test Suite Hardened & Bugs Fixed:** An initial verification of the project led to the discovery of several latent bugs in the authentication unit tests and a critical runtime `TypeError` related to timezone handling. All of these issues have been fixed, and the test suite is now 100% passing.

*   **New Architectural Proposal: Metadata System:** A comprehensive proposal for a new **Plugin-Driven Multi-Source Metadata System** was designed and documented. This major feature, which builds on the existing Dynamic Plugin System proposal, will allow the Zotify Platform to ingest and query metadata from any number of sources in a unified way. The proposal has been fully integrated into the project's living documentation (`FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`, `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`, etc.) and is ready for future implementation.

*   **Previous Accomplishments Confirmed:** The verification process also re-confirmed the significant work completed previously, including the `snitch` application repair and the hardening of the Flexible Logging Framework.

2. Known Issues & Blockers

There are no known bugs, regressions, or blockers. The test suite is 100% passing, and recently discovered runtime issues have been resolved. All assigned tasks for this session are complete.

3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The project is in a highly stable, well-documented state. The next phase of work could focus on:

*   Implementing the new **Plugin-Driven Multi-Source Metadata System** as a proof-of-concept.
*   Implementing the **Dynamic Plugin System** for the logging framework as a proof-of-concept.
*   Beginning the comprehensive documentation quality upgrade by refactoring key manuals to the new, higher standard.
