# Project State as of 2025-08-25

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session focused on hardening the CI/CD pipeline and implementing a new suite of developer tooling to enforce documentation-as-code principles, completing **Phase 4c** of the alignment plan.

*   **CI/CD Pipeline Stabilized:** All CI jobs are now consistently passing. A persistent, complex `golangci-lint` failure was debugged and resolved by aligning the Go version in the `snitch/go.mod` file with the CI runner's toolchain. The initial `security-scan` failure was also resolved.
*   **Custom Documentation Linter:** A new linter (`scripts/lint-docs.py`) was created and integrated into the CI pipeline. It automatically verifies that code changes are accompanied by corresponding documentation changes, enforcing the "living documentation" policy.
*   **Local Pre-commit Hooks:** The `pre-commit` framework was introduced to run the new documentation linter locally on every commit. This provides developers with immediate feedback and prevents documentation policy violations from entering the codebase.
*   **Documentation Conventions & Templates:** A new file naming convention (`UPPERCASE.md`) has been established. A comprehensive set of reusable documentation templates has been imported into `templates/` to bootstrap future projects and ensure consistency.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers

There are **no known issues or blockers**. The project is in a highly stable state with a green CI pipeline and robust, automated quality gates.

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

All planned work for Phase 4 of the HLD/LLD Alignment Plan is now complete. The project's tooling and documentation infrastructure has been significantly hardened. The next developer can begin a new phase of work, such as implementing new features from the `project/BACKLOG.md` or beginning a new audit/alignment cycle.
