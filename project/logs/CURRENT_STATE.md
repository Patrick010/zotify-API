# Project State as of 2025-08-24

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session focused on completing the comprehensive **Phase 4a static analysis and technical debt remediation**. This involved several major accomplishments that have significantly improved the robustness, maintainability, and reliability of the codebase.

*   **`mypy` Remediation Complete:** The entire `api` module, including all application source code (`api/src`) and the test suite (`api/tests`), now passes a `mypy --strict` check with zero errors. This resolved over 600 initial errors.
*   **SQLAlchemy 2.0 Refactor:** All database models were migrated to the modern SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM syntax to ensure compatibility with the `mypy` plugin.
*   **Test Suite Stabilized:** The process of adding types uncovered and led to the resolution of numerous latent bugs. The full `pytest` suite of 204 tests is now 100% passing.
*   **CI/CD Integration:** A comprehensive CI/CD pipeline was implemented in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. This pipeline now automatically runs linting (`ruff`), type checking (`mypy`), security scans (`bandit`, `safety`), and the full test suite on every pull request.
*   **Multi-Language Linting:** All `golangci-lint` issues in the `snitch` microservice were remediated.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers

*   **Critical Blocker:** The CI pipeline is currently **failing**.
    *   **Job:** `security-scan`
    *   **Error:** The job fails with exit code 1.
    *   **Cause:** The `safety` vulnerability scanner is exiting with a non-zero code. An initial attempt to fix this by ignoring known vulnerability IDs with the deprecated `safety check` command failed.
    *   **Current Investigation:** The root cause is believed to be the unreliability of the deprecated `safety check` command in the CI environment. The correct solution, which is currently in progress, is to switch to the modern `safety scan` command and use a `.safety-policy.yml` file to manage vulnerability ignores.

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The immediate priority is to resolve the CI failure. The next developer should pick up the work of implementing the `.safety-policy.yml` file. All other work is blocked until the CI pipeline is green.
