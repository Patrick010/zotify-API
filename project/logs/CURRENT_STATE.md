Project State as of 2025-08-19

Status: Live Document

1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session focused on improving the project's process documentation for future development.

*   **Phase 3 Guidance Clarified:** The `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md` was updated to clarify the goal of the current project phase. The phase was renamed to "Implementation & Alignment" and the goal description was updated to make it explicit that the work involves implementing missing features, not just updating documentation. A revised Handover Brief template was also generated to reflect this.

*   **Process Documentation Enhanced:** Key process documents were updated to improve clarity and enforcement. The `TASK_CHECKLIST.md` was restructured to be more efficient and its mandatory nature was emphasized in the `ONBOARDING.md` file.

2. Known Issues & Blockers

There are no known bugs, regressions, or blockers. The project is in a stable, verified state with improved process documentation.

3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The project is ready to begin the **Implementation & Alignment** phase, starting with the `JWT for API Authentication` task.
