# Project State as of 2025-08-29

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

The new Automated Documentation Workflow system is now fully implemented and corrected. All project logs have been updated and corrected to reflect the work done and to align with the project's logging philosophy. The system is ready for final review.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers

- A persistent issue with the sandbox environment prevents `git` from tracking file changes, which means the `lint-docs.py` script cannot run automatically. This has been noted in the audit report for Phase 5.

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

- Final code review and submission of the new workflow tooling and all corrections.
