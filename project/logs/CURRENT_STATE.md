Project State as of 2025-08-20

Status: Live Document

1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session focused on hardening the project's stability and ensuring long-term code quality by significantly increasing the test coverage of the API.

*   **Test Coverage Increased to >90%:** After a significant effort, the total test coverage for the API was increased from 83% to **90.01%**. This was achieved by adding over 60 new unit tests, targeting previously under-tested modules across the application. The entire test suite of 199 tests is now passing.

*   **CI Coverage Gate Implemented:** A new GitHub Actions workflow was created at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. This workflow will automatically run on all future pull requests and will fail if the test coverage drops below 85%, preventing future regressions in code quality.

*   **Code Quality Improved:** The process of writing new tests uncovered and led to the fixing of several latent bugs in the application code and the test suite itself, further improving the overall stability of the project.

2. Known Issues & Blockers

There are no known bugs, regressions, or blockers. The project is in a stable state with a robust test suite.

3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

All coding and documentation tasks for this session are complete. The project is ready for a final review before submission.
