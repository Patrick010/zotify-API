Project State as of 2025-08-19

Status: Live Document

1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session focused on continuing the "Phase 3: Incremental Design Updates" by addressing items from the audit traceability matrix.

*   **Initial State Verified:** As a first step, an independent verification of the "Trinity" documents (`CURRENT_STATE.md`, `ACTIVITY.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md`) was performed. The claims in these documents were checked against the codebase, including running the full test suite (139 tests passed) and examining key source files. The Trinity was found to be an accurate reflection of reality.

*   **JWT Documentation Gap Closed:** The `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a documentation gap related to "JWT for API Authentication". An investigation revealed that the design documents were already correct, but the matrix itself was outdated. The matrix has now been corrected to reflect that the documentation is aligned with the codebase, closing the gap.

2. Known Issues & Blockers

There are no known bugs, regressions, or blockers. The project remains in a stable, verified state.

3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The project is ready for the next documentation alignment task from the `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`. The next likely candidates are:
*   `Security Enhancements`
*   `Test Coverage > 90% & Gating`
