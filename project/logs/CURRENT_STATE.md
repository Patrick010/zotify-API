1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session has continued the work of the **Implementation & Alignment** phase. The primary focus was to resume the task of increasing the project's test coverage, with a new goal of 100%.

*   **Test Coverage Significantly Increased:** A comprehensive effort was undertaken to improve the test suite.
    *   The test environment was fixed by installing missing dependencies and creating required directories.
    *   Overall project test coverage was raised from **83% to 87%**.
    *   Coverage for `api/src/zotify_api/database/crud.py` was raised to **100%**.
    *   Coverage for `api/src/zotify_api/services/auth.py` was raised to **96%**.
    *   Coverage for `api/src/zotify_api/providers/spotify_connector.py` was raised to **86%**.
    *   The test suite now contains 170 passing tests.

*   **Process Documentation Hardened:** As a preliminary step, the `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md` was updated to include a rule for handling "N/N" discrepancies, further clarifying the project's alignment process.

2. Known Issues & Blockers

There are no known bugs or blockers. The test suite is stable. The remaining work involves incrementally increasing test coverage on lower-priority files and implementing CI gating.

3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The project continues with the **Implementation & Alignment** phase. The next step is to investigate and implement CI gating to enforce test coverage standards, as outlined in the execution plan.
