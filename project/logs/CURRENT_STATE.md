# Project State as of 2025-08-24

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session focused on completing the comprehensive **Phase 4a static analysis and technical debt remediation**. This involved several major accomplishments that have significantly improved the robustness, maintainability, and reliability of the codebase.

*   **`mypy` Remediation Complete:** The entire `api` module, including all application source code (`api/src`) and the test suite (`api/tests`), now passes a `mypy --strict` check with zero errors.
*   **SQLAlchemy 2.0 Refactor:** All database models were migrated to the modern SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM syntax to ensure compatibility with the `mypy` plugin.
*   **Test Suite Stabilized:** The process of adding types uncovered and led to the resolution of numerous latent bugs. The full `pytest` suite of 204 tests is now 100% passing.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Unblocked:** The `security-scan` job, which was blocking the CI pipeline, has been fixed. The root cause was identified as the `bandit` scanner, and a robust fix has been implemented and verified.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers

There are **no known issues or blockers**. The project is in a clean state with a fully passing test suite and CI pipeline.

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

All blockers related to Phase 4a have been resolved. The project is now ready to proceed to **Phase 4b: CI/CD Hardening**. The next developer can pick up the tasks outlined for this phase in the `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md` document.
