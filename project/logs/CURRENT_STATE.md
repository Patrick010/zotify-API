Project State as of 2025-08-19

Status: Live Document

1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session focused on performing a full, independent audit of the project to verify the claims made in the "living documentation."

*   **Project State Verified:** The audit confirmed that the project's core application logic is stable and accurately reflected in the documentation. The `snitch` helper, `gonk-testUI`, and Logging Framework all function as described.

*   **Documentation Hardened:** The audit process uncovered and fixed several gaps in the project's documentation, improving its accuracy and usability for future developers.
    *   The `INSTALLATION.md` guide for the API was updated with critical, missing setup steps that previously caused the server to crash on startup.
    *   The documented API test count was corrected across `ACTIVITY.md` and `SESSION_LOG.md` to reflect the actual number of tests (139).

*   **Previous State Confirmed:** The audit re-verified the stability of the codebase, the 100% passing test suite, and the successful completion of all work from the previous session.

2. Known Issues & Blockers

There are no known bugs, regressions, or blockers. The project is in a stable, verified state.

3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The project remains ready for the next major phase of development. Immediate next steps could focus on:

*   Implementing the new **Plugin-Driven Multi-Source Metadata System** as a proof-of-concept.
*   Implementing the **Dynamic Plugin System** for the logging framework as a proof-of-concept.
*   Beginning the comprehensive documentation quality upgrade by refactoring key manuals to the new, higher standard.
