# Project State as of 2025-09-01

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments
- **Snitch Project Plan:** Created a new, comprehensive `PROJECT_PLAN.md` for the Snitch module and updated the main `PID.md` and `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` to formally track it.
- **Archive Cleanup & Documentation Consolidation:** A major documentation task was completed, including deleting obsolete files, migrating valuable content, and designing a new GDPR feature.
- **Process Documentation Update:** The `AGENTS.md` file was updated to clarify the manual execution policy for the `log-work.py` script.
- **Trinity Logs Synchronized:** All three Trinity log files have been updated to reflect all work completed in the session.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers
- The `notifications` endpoints are known to be unauthenticated, as documented in `project/SECURITY.md`. This should be addressed when a full user authentication system is implemented.

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps
- The next task is to create a new project plan for the `gonk-testUI` module, as per the user's latest request.
