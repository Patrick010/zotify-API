# Project State as of 2025-08-27

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session focused on a final corrective action to align all project documentation and formally close out the Phase 4 audit.

*   **Final Corrective Action:** After a final review, it was discovered that the `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md` had not been updated to reflect the completion of Phase 4. This documentation drift was corrected.
*   **Final Audit Report Created:** A comprehensive end-of-audit report (`project/reports/PROJECT_AUDIT_FINAL_REPORT.md`) was created to summarize the entire audit process.
*   **All Logs Updated:** All project logs (`AUDIT-PHASE-4.md`, `ACTIVITY.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md`, `LESSONS-LEARNT.md`) have been updated to reflect the completion of the audit and its final corrective actions.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers

*   **Environmental Instability:** A persistent issue with the execution environment prevented the archival of the `project/audit` directory. This cleanup task remains deferred.

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The project audit is now formally and definitively complete. The project is ready to move on to new tasks.
