# Project State as of 2025-08-31

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments
- The `mkdocs` build system has been reconfigured to use the `mkdocs-monorepo-plugin`, which now correctly builds a unified site from the `api/`, `snitch/`, and `gonk-testUI/` modules while excluding the `project/` module.
- A `FileExistsError` bug during the build process was diagnosed by the user as being caused by leftover symlinks.
- A `TypeError` regression in the Spotify authentication callback (`object dict can't be used in 'await' expression`) was identified and fixed by removing an erroneous `await` keyword.
- The repository is in a stable and verified state. All tests pass and the documentation builds cleanly.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers
- None

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps
- (To be filled in manually)
