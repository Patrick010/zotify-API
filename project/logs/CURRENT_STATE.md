# Project State as of 2025-08-28

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session concluded a major initiative focused on repository organization and the implementation of a new quality assurance framework. The project is now significantly cleaner and has robust processes for tracking and improving code quality.

*   **Comprehensive Repository Cleanup:** The root directory was decluttered by moving 8 utility scripts to `scripts/`, relocating `DEPENDENCIES.md` to `project/`, and deleting 5 obsolete files. All project documentation and registries have been updated.
*   **Code Quality Index Framework:** A new system for tracking code quality has been implemented across all three modules (`api`, `snitch`, `gonk-testUI`). Each module now has a `CODE_QUALITY_INDEX.md` file with a two-column scoring rubric for "Documentation" and "Code" quality.
*   **Baseline Quality Assessment:** A baseline quality assessment was performed for all source files in the `snitch` and `gonk-testUI` modules, and a partial assessment for the `api` module.
*   **"Gold Standard" Example:** A comprehensive documentation file for `api/src/zotify_api/services/tracks_service.py` was created to serve as an example of 'A'-grade documentation.
*   **Process Formalization:** A "Code QA" step has been added to every phase in the `project/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The project is now in a stable state, ready for the next phase of development. Future work can be guided by:
1.  Improving the scores of files in the new **Code Quality Indexes**.
2.  Selecting the next feature or task from the `project/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`.
