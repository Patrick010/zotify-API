# Project State as of 2025-08-31

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments
- **`mkdocs-monorepo-plugin` Implementation:** The `mkdocs` build system was successfully reconfigured to use the `mkdocs-monorepo-plugin`. This involved creating `mkdocs.yml` files for the `snitch` and `gonk-testUI` modules and updating the root `mkdocs.yml` to correctly include their documentation while excluding the `project` directory.
- **Build System Debugging:** Resolved a `FileExistsError` during the `mkdocs build` process, which was caused by stale symlinks from previous build attempts.
- **Regression Fix (Spotify Auth):** Identified and fixed a `TypeError` regression in the Spotify authentication flow (`ACT-033`). The fix involved removing an erroneous `await` keyword from a non-async function call in `spotify_connector.py` and correcting the corresponding unit test mock.
- **Documentation Link Fixes:** The `MASTER_INDEX.md` file was moved to its correct location at the root of the `api/docs` directory, and all broken links within the documentation were updated.
- **Repository State:** The repository is now in a stable, fully documented, and verified state. All tests are passing, and the documentation builds without errors.
