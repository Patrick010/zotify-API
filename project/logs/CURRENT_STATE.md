# Project State as of 2025-08-28

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session focused on a broad-based initiative to improve repository organization and formalize quality assurance processes. The work was triggered by user feedback on a previous submission.

*   **Repository Cleanup:** The root directory has been significantly cleaned. Helper scripts have been moved to the `scripts/` directory, `DEPENDENCIES.md` has been moved to `project/`, and several temporary/obsolete files have been deleted.
*   **Code Quality Index:** A new system for tracking the quality of source code has been established. This includes the new `api/docs/reference/CODE_QUALITY_INDEX.md` file and updates to the `API_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.
*   **Process Formalization:** A "Code QA" step has been added to every phase of the `project/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`, creating a consistent quality gate for all future work.
*   **Tooling Hardened:** The documentation linter (`scripts/lint-docs.py`) was refactored to use a `project/lint-rules.yml` config file and was made more robust to prevent silent failures.
*   **Final Log Updates:** All Trinity log files have been updated to reflect these changes.
