# Project State as of 2025-08-23

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session has focused on the `mypy` static analysis portion of **Phase 4a: Technical Debt Remediation**.

*   **`mypy` Configuration and Environment:** Successfully diagnosed and resolved numerous foundational issues that were preventing an accurate `mypy` analysis. This included:
    *   Forcing `mypy` to use the correct `api/mypy.ini` configuration.
    *   Refactoring the SQLAlchemy database models to the modern 2.0 ORM style to fix the `sqlalchemy-mypy` plugin.
    *   Enabling the `pydantic-mypy` plugin.
    *   Resolving dependency conflicts and ensuring the correct Python environment was used for the scan.
*   **Application Code Typed:** All `mypy` errors in the application source code (`api/src/`) have been successfully remediated. The `src` codebase is now fully typed.
*   **Test Code Remediation In Progress:** A systematic process of fixing the remaining errors in the test suite is underway.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers

*   There are no known blockers at this time. The remaining work involves the methodical application of type hints to the test suite.

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

*   **Complete `mypy` Remediation:** Continue the file-by-file remediation of the test suite until all `mypy` errors are resolved.
*   **Final `pytest` Verification:** Run the full `pytest` suite to ensure no regressions were introduced during the typing effort.
*   **Commit Work:** All work from this session will be committed on the `audit-phase-4j` branch after this documentation is updated.
