# Project State as of 2025-10-21

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments
Fixed a bug in the linter's logging logic that incorrectly prepended new log entries, pushing the required <!-- ID: ... --> comment down from the first line of the file. Also manually corrected the log files that were broken by this bug.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers
- None

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps
With the linter and the log files now in a correct state, the next step is to run the linter's pre-submission verification to ensure all changes are compliant before submitting.
