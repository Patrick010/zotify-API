Project State as of 2025-08-19

Status: Live Document

1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session focused on a series of deep audits to verify and improve the project's "living documentation" and enforce its policies.

*   **Phase 3 Audit Log Corrected:** A detailed investigation of the `AUDIT-PHASE-3.md` log revealed it was an inaccurate record of the work performed. The log has been corrected to reflect the true implementation of the database and download queue systems, and the overall Phase 3 status has been marked as "Done".

*   **Task Checklist Modernized:** The `TASK_CHECKLIST.md` was audited and found to be severely outdated. It has been corrected by removing obsolete instructions, updating all file paths, and clarifying the documentation review process.

*   **Project Registry Corrected:** An audit of the `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` file was completed. It was synchronized with the filesystem by removing 4 ghost entries and adding 2 unregistered files.

*   **Initial Audit Findings:** An initial audit confirmed the project's stability and corrected several minor documentation issues, including the API test count in the logs and missing setup steps in the `INSTALLATION.md`.

2. Known Issues & Blockers

There are no known bugs, regressions, or blockers. The project is in a stable, verified state with a high degree of documentation accuracy and process alignment.

3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The project remains ready for the next major phase of development. Immediate next steps could focus on:

*   Implementing the new **Plugin-Driven Multi-Source Metadata System** as a proof-of-concept.
*   Implementing the **Dynamic Plugin System** for the logging framework as a proof-of-concept.
*   Beginning the comprehensive documentation quality upgrade by refactoring key manuals to the new, higher standard.
