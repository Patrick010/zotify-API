**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session concluded the comprehensive, multi-phase project audit. The primary focus was on producing a final audit report, updating key process documents, and formally closing out the audit activities.

*   **Final Audit Report Created:** A comprehensive end-of-audit report (`project/reports/PROJECT_AUDIT_FINAL_REPORT.md`) was created, summarizing the audit's purpose, process, outcomes, and lessons learned.
*   **Lessons Learned Documented:** The `project/LESSONS-LEARNT.md` file was updated with a verbose and detailed summary of the key takeaways from the entire audit process, focusing on documentation strategy and the importance of automated enforcement.
*   **Project Logs Updated:** All relevant project logs (`AUDIT-PHASE-4.md`, `ACTIVITY.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md`) have been updated to reflect the completion of the audit.
*   **Project Registry Updated:** The `project/PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` was updated to include the new final audit report.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers

*   **Environmental Instability:** A persistent issue with the execution environment prevented the archival of the `project/audit` directory as requested. This cleanup task has been deferred.

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The project audit is now formally complete. The next phase of work can begin, guided by the recommendations in the final audit report and the project's backlog.
