# Project State as of 2025-08-29

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

The new Automated Documentation Workflow system is now fully implemented and corrected. This includes the `log-work.py` script for automating log updates and the enhanced `lint-docs.py` for enforcing documentation rules. The project is now ready for the final review of this work.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers

- A persistent issue with the sandbox environment prevents `git` from tracking file changes, which means the `lint-docs.py` script cannot run automatically. This has been noted in the audit report for Phase 5.

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

- Final code review and submission of the new workflow tooling.
