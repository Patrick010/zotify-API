# Project State as of 2025-09-01

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments
- **Archive Cleanup & Documentation Consolidation:** A major documentation task was completed. Over 20 obsolete files were deleted from `project/archive/`.
- **Documentation Enriched:** Valuable historical context from the archive was migrated into the live `CHANGELOG.md`, `SYSTEM_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`, and `SECURITY.md`.
- **New Feature Designed & Tracked:** A documentation gap regarding GDPR compliance was resolved by designing the required `/privacy/data` endpoints in the LLD and adding a new implementation task (`FEAT-PRIVACY-01`) to the project backlog.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers
- The `notifications` endpoints are known to be unauthenticated, as documented in `project/SECURITY.md`. This should be addressed when a full user authentication system is implemented.

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps
- The project's documentation and backlog are now in a clean and well-defined state. The next logical step is to begin work on one of the high-priority features from the backlog:
    - **`FEAT-PRIVACY-01`**: Implement the newly designed GDPR endpoints.
    - **`FEAT-SDK-01`**: Implement the dynamic plugin system for the logging framework.
