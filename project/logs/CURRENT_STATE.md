# Project State as of 2025-08-27

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session performed a final, comprehensive implementation and consolidation of all Phase 4 audit tasks. After multiple environmental issues and process misunderstandings were resolved, a final, complete set of changes was applied to the repository.

*   **"Super-Lint" Plan Implemented:** All gaps identified between the detailed "Super-Lint" plan and the previous state were filled. This included enabling the `gosec` linter, enhancing the documentation linter with the "Trinity Rule", completing the pre-commit hook setup, and formalizing the code review process in the `TASK_CHECKLIST.md`.
*   **Documentation Consolidated:** All planning documents for Phase 4 have been reconciled, with the `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md` and `PHASE_4_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` serving as the final, canonical sources of truth.
*   **Final Logs Updated:** All audit and project logs have been updated to reflect the completion of this work.

## 2. Known Issues & Blockers

There are **no known issues or blockers**. All work for the project audit is complete.

## 3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps
