## Scripts & Workflows (to internalize, not execute)
| File / Component | Type | Workflow / Role | Notes |
|-----------------|------|----------------|-------|
| <file1> | script/doc/config | <audit, validation, testing, docs> | <Purpose / details> |
| <file2> | script/doc/config | <workflow> | <Notes> |
| **🆕 <fileX>** | script/doc/config | <New workflow in this session> | <Details / purpose> |

## Tasks & Incremental Steps (study objectives)
1. **Internalize repository structure**  
   - Map scripts, docs, tests, configs.  
   - Understand interdependencies and workflows.
2. **Governance & Alignment**  
   - Study ID assignment system, alignment matrices, and document inventories.
3. **NLP / Semantic Enrichment Tasks**  
   - Summarization, tagging, and intermediate outputs.
4. **Validation & QA**  
   - Review linter outputs, matrix checks, and audit reports.
5. **Incremental Execution Planning**  
   - Identify pending validations or unresolved items.

## Session Summary
- ✅ Completed tasks / workflows / scripts added or updated  
- ⚠️ Pending tasks / unresolved issues  
- ⚙️ Next steps for continuation (Phase X or session Y)

---

## Session Continuation Directives
- Resume at **Step X** in the repo task plan.  
- Validate and integrate NLP-generated descriptions.  
- Sync `DOCUMENT_TAG_INVENTORY.yml` and `ALIGNMENT_MATRIX.yml`.  
- Perform governance QA: check for missing IDs, broken references, empty descriptions.  
- Document failures and edge cases for handoff.  
- Prepare repo for next phase automation or deployment.

> **Done Definition:**  
> A developer or assistant is fully onboarded when they can:
> - Explain all scripts, docs, and workflows in the repo.
> - Map governance, alignment, and semantic enrichment flows.
> - Identify unresolved items and dependencies.
> - Continue Phase X/Y tasks without external guidance.
