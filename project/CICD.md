# CI/CD Philosophy and Quality Gates

## 1. Purpose
This document provides a high-level overview of the Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for this project. It is intended for a project management and stakeholder audience, explaining the purpose and value of each quality gate in the development process.

For a detailed technical guide for developers, please see the `Developer CI/CD Guide` located in the `api/docs/manuals` directory.

## 2. Core Philosophy

Our development process is built on two principles:

-   **Catch Errors Early and Locally:** Developers receive immediate feedback on their machines *before* they commit code. This is handled by automated "pre-commit hooks" and is designed to catch simple style or logic errors quickly, speeding up the development loop.
-   **Guarantee Centralized Quality:** Before any code can be merged into the `main` branch, it must pass a rigorous suite of automated checks in a clean, centralized environment (GitHub Actions). This is our ultimate guarantee of quality and stability.

## 3. The CI/CD Pipeline: Our Automated Quality Gates

When a developer submits a pull request, a series of automated jobs run to validate the changes. The pull request cannot be merged until all jobs pass.

### Key Jobs and Their Purpose:

-   **`test`**
    -   **Purpose:** To guarantee the application's logic works as expected and prevent regressions.
    -   **What it does:** Runs the entire suite of automated tests and verifies that test coverage (the percentage of code exercised by tests) does not fall below a critical threshold.

-   **`lint`**
    -   **Purpose:** To ensure the code is clean, readable, and consistent with project style guides.
    -   **What it does:** Uses industry-standard "linters" (`ruff` for Python, `golangci-lint` for Go) to check for stylistic errors, formatting issues, and common code smells.

-   **`type-check`**
    -   **Purpose:** To catch a whole class of bugs related to data types before the code is ever run.
    -   **What it does:** Uses a "static type checker" (`mypy`) to analyze the code and ensure that all data flows correctly between different parts of the application.

-   **`security-scan`**
    -   **Purpose:** To proactively identify potential security vulnerabilities.
    -   **What it does:** Runs multiple security tools (`bandit`, `safety`) that scan the code for common security flaws and check our dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

-   **`doc-linter`**
    -   **Purpose:** To enforce our "living documentation" policy automatically.
    -   **What it does:** Runs a custom-built script that ensures that whenever a developer changes code, they also make a corresponding update to the project's documentation in the same pull request.

## 4. Conclusion

This automated pipeline serves as the foundation of our quality assurance strategy. It allows the development team to move quickly while providing project stakeholders with confidence that every change meets our high standards for correctness, style, security, and documentation.
