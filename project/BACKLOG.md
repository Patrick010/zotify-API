# Project Backlog

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Purpose

This document serves as the tactical backlog for the Zotify API project. It contains a list of clearly defined tasks that have been approved for implementation but are not yet assigned to a specific sprint or work cycle. This provides a work supply for future phases and ensures that good ideas are not lost.

Tasks in this backlog are distinct from the strategic, high-level goals outlined in `FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`.

## 2. Backlog Items

Items are to be flagged with a priority (`[HIGH]`, `[MEDIUM]`, `[LOW]`) to aid in work planning.

### `P4-TASK-01` [HIGH]: Update Task Execution Checklist with Documentation Mandate
- **Description:** This task involves adding a mandatory step to the project's `task_checklist.md`. This step will require developers to confirm they have updated all relevant project documentation as part of their pull request, making documentation updates an explicit part of the development workflow.
- **Source:** `project/audit/HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md` (Phase 4, Task 4.1)

### `P4-TASK-02` [MEDIUM]: Implement CI Check for Documentation Updates
- **Description:** This task is to create an automated check within the CI/CD pipeline to enforce the documentation update mandate. This will serve as an automated safeguard to prevent code changes from being merged without corresponding documentation updates.
- **Source:** `project/audit/HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md` (Phase 4, Task 4.2)

---

### `P4-TASK-03` [LOW]: Formalize and Schedule Documentation Review Process
- **Description:** This task involves defining and documenting a formal process for periodic reviews of the project's design documents. This process will specify the cadence, scope, and responsibilities for the reviews to proactively maintain documentation quality.
- **Source:** `project/audit/HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md` (Phase 4, Task 4.3)
