# Project Backlog

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Purpose

This document serves as the tactical backlog for the Zotify API project. It contains a list of clearly defined tasks that have been approved for implementation but are not yet assigned to a specific sprint or work cycle.

The process for managing this backlog is defined in the `PID.md` and is designed to ensure that every task is traceable, fully defined, and qualified for execution.

---

## 2. Backlog Management Flow

The following diagram illustrates the process of generating, qualifying, and executing tasks from the backlog.
