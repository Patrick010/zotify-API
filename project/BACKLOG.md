# Project Backlog

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Purpose

This document serves as the tactical backlog for the Zotify API project. It contains a list of clearly defined tasks that have been approved for implementation but are not yet assigned to a specific sprint or work cycle. This provides a work supply for future phases and ensures that good ideas are not lost.

Tasks in this backlog are distinct from the strategic, high-level goals outlined in `FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`.

## 2. Backlog Items

Items are to be flagged with a priority (`[HIGH]`, `[MEDIUM]`, `[LOW]`) to aid in work planning.

### Unprioritized

- *Example Task:* Refactor the logging service to use a structured logging format.
