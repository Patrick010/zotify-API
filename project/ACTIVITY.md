## ACT-034: Resolve `snitch` Regression and Harden Logging Framework

**Date:** 2025-08-18
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To fix a critical regression in the `snitch` helper application, and then, based on user feedback, implement a series of significant enhancements to the Flexible Logging Framework to improve its security, flexibility, and configurability.

### Outcome
1.  **`snitch` Application Repaired:**
    -   A persistent build issue, originally believed to be a caching problem, was diagnosed as a structural conflict in the Go module.
    -   The application was radically refactored into a single, self-contained `snitch.go` file, which resolved the build issue.
    -   A subsequent `TypeError` in the Python API's callback handler, revealed by the now-working `snitch` app, was also fixed.

2.  **Flexible Logging Framework Hardened:**
    -   **Security Redaction:** A `SensitiveDataFilter` was implemented to automatically redact sensitive data (tokens, codes) from all log messages when the `APP_ENV` is set to `production`. This was implemented in both the Python API and the `snitch` Go application.
    -   **Tag-Based Routing:** The framework's trigger system was upgraded to support tag-based routing. This allows administrators to route logs to specific sinks based on tags (e.g., `"security"`) defined in `logging_framework.yml`, decoupling the logging of an event from its handling.
    -   **Security Log:** A dedicated `security.log` sink was configured, and both successful and failed authentication events are now tagged to be routed to this log, providing a complete audit trail.
    -   **Duplicate Log Fix:** A bug that caused duplicate entries in the security log was fixed by making the original `log_event` call more specific about its primary destinations.

## ACT-033: Fix API TypeError in Spotify Callback

**Date:** 2025-08-18
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To fix a `TypeError` in the `/api/auth/spotify/callback` endpoint that occurred after the `snitch` helper application was repaired.

### Outcome
- **Root Cause Analysis:** A `TypeError: object dict can't be used in 'await' expression` was traced to line 68 of `api/src/zotify_api/routes/auth.py`. The code was attempting to `await resp.json()`, but the runtime environment was not treating this as an awaitable coroutine.
- **Fix:** The `await` keyword was removed from the `resp.json()` call, resolving the `TypeError`.

## ACT-032: Debug and Refactor `snitch` Go Application

**Date:** 2025-08-18
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To diagnose and resolve a persistent, complex build issue with the `snitch` helper application that was blocking all CLI-based authentication flows.

### Outcome
- **Investigation:** A deep investigation revealed the root cause was not a simple caching issue, but a structural conflict in the Go module. A legacy `snitch.go` file with a `main` package was conflicting with the intended entry point at `cmd/snitch/main.go`. This ambiguity caused the Go compiler to produce a binary with stale, incorrect code.
- **Refactoring:** To resolve this, the `snitch` application was radically simplified. The `cmd/` and `internal/` directories were deleted, and all logic was consolidated into a single, self-contained `snitch.go` file. This file was rewritten to be a clean `package main` application with the correct `http.Get` logic, eliminating all structural ambiguity.
- **Validation:** The new simplified `snitch.go` was successfully built by the user, and a subsequent `TypeError` in the Python backend was identified, proving the `snitch` application was now working correctly.

## ACT-031: API Canonicalization, Documentation Overhaul, and Snitch Regression Fix

**Date:** 2025-08-17
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
A comprehensive refactoring of the entire API was completed to enforce a canonical standard for endpoints, responses, and file structure. All API and project documentation was updated to align with this new reality. The test suite was updated and is 100% passing for the API.

### Outcome
- **API Refactoring:** Standardized all API routes and responses. Consolidated auth logic and removed redundant routers (`spotify.py`, `metadata.py`).
- **Documentation:** Generated new `API_REFERENCE.md` from OpenAPI spec. Updated `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `ENDPOINTS.md`, `EXECUTION_PLAN.md`, and `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`. Archived old files.
- **Validation:** Updated all 135 tests in the API test suite to pass against the new canonical structure.
-  **Snitch Regression:**
   -   Discovered that the API refactoring broke the `snitch` helper application.
   -   Modified `snitch` Go source code (`handler.go`) to use `GET` instead of `POST`.
   -   Updated `snitch` documentation (`README.md`, `USER_MANUAL.md`).
   -   **Issue:** Encountered a persistent build issue where the compiled `snitch.exe` does not reflect the source code changes. This issue is unresolved.

## ACT-014: Fix Authentication Timezone Bug

**Date:** 2025-08-14
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To fix a recurring `500 Internal Server Error` caused by a `TypeError` when comparing timezone-aware and timezone-naive datetime objects during authentication status checks.

### Outcome
- **Root Cause Analysis:** The ultimate root cause was identified as the database layer (SQLAlchemy on SQLite) not preserving timezone information, even when timezone-aware datetime objects were passed to it.
- **Initial Fix:** The `SpotifyToken` model in `api/src/zotify_api/database/models.py` was modified to use `DateTime(timezone=True)`, which correctly handles timezone persistence.
- **Resilience Fix:** The `get_auth_status` function was made more resilient by adding a `try...except TypeError` block to gracefully handle any legacy, timezone-naive data that might exist in the database, preventing future crashes.
