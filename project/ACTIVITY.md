## ACT-021: Verify and Integrate Existing Logging System

**Date:** 2025-08-17
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To investigate the true implementation status of the new Logging System and integrate it into the main application, correcting the project's documentation along the way.

### Outcome
- **Investigation:**
    - Confirmed that the "New Logging System" was, contrary to previous reports, already substantially implemented. All major components (Service, Handlers, DB Model, Config, and Unit Tests) were present in the codebase.
- **Integration:**
    - The `LoggingService` was integrated into the FastAPI application's startup event in `main.py`.
    - The old, basic `logging.basicConfig` setup was removed.
    - A minor code style issue (misplaced import) in `test_new_logging_system.py` was corrected.
- **Verification:**
    - The full test suite (133 tests) was run and confirmed to be passing after the integration, ensuring no regressions were introduced.

## ACT-020: Refactor Error Handler for Extensibility

**Date:** 2025-08-17
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To refactor the error handling system to allow for pluggable "actions," making it more modular and easier to extend, as defined in `REM-TASK-01`.

### Outcome
- **`TriggerManager` Refactored:**
    - The `TriggerManager` in `triggers.py` was modified to dynamically discover and load action modules from a new `actions/` subdirectory.
    - The hardcoded `log_critical` and `webhook` actions were moved into their own modules within the new `actions/` package.
- **Documentation Updated:**
    - `api/docs/manuals/ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md` was updated to document the new, simpler process for adding custom actions.
- **Verification:**
    - The unit tests for the error handler were successfully run to confirm the refactoring did not introduce regressions.

## ACT-019: Remediate Environment and Documentation

**Date:** 2025-08-17
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To correct key project files to fix the developer environment and align documentation with the codebase's reality, as defined in `REM-TASK-01`.

### Outcome
- **`.gitignore`:** Updated to include `api/storage/` and `api/*.db` to prevent local database files and storage from being committed.
- **`api/docs/system/INSTALLATION.md`:** Updated to include the previously undocumented manual setup steps (`mkdir api/storage`, `APP_ENV=development`) required to run the test suite.
- **`project/ACTIVITY.md`:** The `ACT-015` entry was corrected to accurately reflect that the Error Handling Module was, in fact, implemented and not lost.

## ACT-016: Environment Reset and Recovery

**Date:** 2025-08-15
**Time:** 02:20
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To recover from a critical environment instability that caused tool commands, including `pytest` and `ls`, to hang indefinitely.

### Outcome
- A `reset_all()` command was executed as a last resort to restore a functional environment.
- This action successfully stabilized the environment but reverted all in-progress work on the Generic Error Handling Module (see ACT-015).
- The immediate next step is to re-implement the lost work, starting from the completed design documents.

**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To design a robust, centralized, and extensible error handling module for the entire platform to standardize error responses and improve resilience.

### Outcome
- **Design Phase Completed:**
    - The new module was formally documented in `PID.md`, `HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md`, and `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md`.
    - A new task was added to `ROADMAP.md` to track the initiative.
    - A detailed technical design was created in `api/docs/system/ERROR_HANDLING_DESIGN.md`.
    - New developer and operator guides were created (`ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md`, `OPERATOR_GUIDE.md`).
- **Implementation Status:**
    - The core module skeleton and unit tests were implemented.
    - **Correction (2025-08-17):** The initial report that the implementation was lost was incorrect. The implementation was present and verified as fully functional during a subsequent audit.

## ACT-014: Fix Authentication Timezone Bug

**Date:** 2025-08-14
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To fix a recurring `500 Internal Server Error` caused by a `TypeError` when comparing timezone-aware and timezone-naive datetime objects during authentication status checks.

### Outcome
- **Root Cause Analysis:** The ultimate root cause was identified as the database layer (SQLAlchemy on SQLite) not preserving timezone information, even when timezone-aware datetime objects were passed to it.
- **Initial Fix:** The `SpotifyToken` model in `api/src/zotify_api/database/models.py` was modified to use `DateTime(timezone=True)`, which correctly handles timezone persistence.
- **Resilience Fix:** The `get_auth_status` function was made more resilient by adding a `try...except TypeError` block to gracefully handle any legacy, timezone-naive data that might exist in the database, preventing future crashes.

## ACT-013: Revamp `gonk-testUI` Login Flow

**Date:** 2025-08-13
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To improve the usability and robustness of the Spotify authentication flow in the `gonk-testUI`.

### Outcome
- The login process was moved from a new tab to a managed popup window.
- A polling mechanism was implemented in the UI to check the `/api/auth/status` endpoint, allowing the UI to detect a successful login and close the popup automatically.
- The login button was made state-aware, changing between "Login" and "Logout" based on the true authentication status returned by the API.
- The backend `/api/auth/spotify/callback` was reverted to return clean JSON, decoupling the API from the UI's implementation.
- All related documentation was updated.

## ACT-012: Fix `gonk-testUI` Unresponsive UI Bug

**Date:** 2025-08-13
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To fix a critical bug where the `gonk-testUI` would become completely unresponsive on load.

### Outcome
- The root cause was identified as a JavaScript `TypeError` when trying to add an event listener to a DOM element that might not exist.
- The `gonk-testUI/static/app.js` file was modified to include null checks for all control button elements before attempting to attach event listeners. This makes the script more resilient and prevents it from crashing.
