## ACT-014: Finalize HLD/LLD Documentation Alignment

**Date:** 2025-08-14
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To complete the final alignment tasks for Phase 3 of the `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN`. This involves ensuring the design documents (`HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md`) accurately reflect the current implementation status of non-functional requirements like advanced security and test coverage.

### Outcome
- The `HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` was updated to clarify that advanced security features (JWT, RBAC) and high test coverage targets are future enhancements, not current requirements.
- The document now correctly points to `SECURITY.md` for the security roadmap.
- This change resolves the remaining gaps identified in the `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` and completes the documentation alignment for Phase 3.
- `SECURITY.md` and `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` were reviewed and confirmed to be already in alignment, requiring no changes.

## ACT-013: Revamp `gonk-testUI` Login Flow

**Date:** 2025-08-13
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To improve the usability and robustness of the Spotify authentication flow in the `gonk-testUI`.

### Outcome
- The login process was moved from a new tab to a managed popup window.
- A polling mechanism was implemented in the UI to check the `/api/auth/status` endpoint, allowing the UI to detect a successful login and close the popup automatically.
- The login button was made state-aware, changing between "Login" and "Logout" based on the true authentication status returned by the API.
- The backend `/api/auth/spotify/callback` was reverted to return clean JSON, decoupling the API from the UI's implementation.
- All related documentation was updated.

- `gonk-testUI/static/app.js`
- `api/src/zotify_api/routes/auth.py`
- `gonk-testUI/README.md`

## ACT-012: Fix `gonk-testUI` Unresponsive UI Bug

**Date:** 2025-08-13
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To fix a critical bug where the `gonk-testUI` would become completely unresponsive on load.

### Outcome
- The root cause was identified as a JavaScript `TypeError` when trying to add an event listener to a DOM element that might not exist.
- The `gonk-testUI/static/app.js` file was modified to include null checks for all control button elements before attempting to attach event listeners. This makes the script more resilient and prevents it from crashing.

## ACT-011: Fix `gonk-testUI` Form Layout

**Date:** 2025-08-13
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To improve the user experience of the `gonk-testUI` by placing the API endpoint forms in a more intuitive location.

### Outcome
- The JavaScript logic in `gonk-testUI/static/app.js` was modified to insert the generated form directly below the endpoint button that was clicked, rather than in a fixed container at the bottom of the page.
- The redundant form container was removed from `gonk-testUI/templates/index.html`.

## ACT-010: Add Theme Toggle to `gonk-testUI`

**Date:** 2025-08-13
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To add a dark/light mode theme toggle to the `gonk-testUI` to improve usability.

### Outcome
- Refactored `gonk-testUI/static/styles.css` to use CSS variables for theming.
- Added a theme toggle button with custom SVG icons to `gonk-testUI/templates/index.html`.
- Implemented the theme switching logic in `gonk-testUI/static/app.js`, with the user's preference saved to `localStorage` for persistence.

## ACT-009: Make `gonk-testUI` Server Configurable

**Date:** 2025-08-13
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To allow the `gonk-testUI` server's IP, port, and target API URL to be configured via the command line.

### Outcome
- Modified `gonk-testUI/app.py` to use `argparse` to accept `--ip`, `--port`, and `--api-url` arguments.
- Updated the backend to pass the configured API URL to the frontend by rendering `index.html` as a template.
- Updated the `README.md` and `USER_MANUAL.md` to document the new command-line flags.

## ACT-008: Fix API Startup Crash and Add CORS Policy

**Date:** 2025-08-13
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To fix a `503 Service Unavailable` error that prevented the API from starting correctly and to properly document the required CORS policy.

### Outcome
- Fixed a `NameError` in `api/src/zotify_api/routes/auth.py` that caused the API to crash.
- Added FastAPI's `CORSMiddleware` to `main.py` to allow cross-origin requests from the test UI.
- Improved the developer experience by setting a default `ADMIN_API_KEY` in development mode.
- Documented the CORS policy across all relevant project documents (HLD, LLD, Operator Guide, Traceability Matrix) and logged the work in the audit file.

To formalize the project's management structure by creating a PRINCE2-compliant Project Brief and Project Initiation Document (PID).

### Outcome
- A `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` was created to provide a high-level summary of the project.
- A `PID.md` was created to serve as the 'living document' defining the project's scope, plans, and controls.
- The `CURRENT_STATE.md` and `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` were updated to include these new documents.

## ACT-004: Reorganize Documentation Directories

**Date:** 2025-08-12
**Status:** Obsolete
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To refactor the documentation directory structure for better organization.

### Outcome
- This task was blocked by a persistent issue with the `rename_file` tool in the environment, which prevented the renaming of the `docs/` directory. The task was aborted, and the documentation was left in its current structure.
