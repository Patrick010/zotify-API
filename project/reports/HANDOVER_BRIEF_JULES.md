Handover Brief: File & Directory Refactoring

Date: 2025-09-27 
Author: Jules
Status: In Progress

1. Context

The current task is a code hygiene and refactoring initiative. The primary goal is to clean up the project's file structure by moving two handover documents into a centralized project/reports/ directory and updating all internal references to reflect these changes.

This task was initiated immediately after a series of significant changes were made to the repository's governance scripts and after a large-scale effort to fix all outstanding linter violations.

2. Work Summary & Current Status

My initial attempt at this refactoring task was combined with the previous work of fixing linter violations. A code review correctly identified that this approach was incorrect, as it resulted in a "noisy" and unfocused set of changes. A clean commit containing only the file refactoring is required.

To rectify this, I have just taken the following action:

    Workspace Reset: I have reverted the entire repository to a clean state, undoing all previous changes from this session.

The repository is now ready to be worked on for this specific refactoring task in isolation.
3. Next Immediate Steps & Plan

The next developer must now execute the approved plan for this refactoring task. The plan is as follows:

    Move the ChatGPT Handover Brief:
        Action: Move the file from api/project/reports/HANDOVER_BRIEF_CHATGTP.md to project/reports/HANDOVER_BRIEF_CHATGTP.md.

    Delete Empty Directories:
        Action: After the move, the api/project/ directory should be deleted.
        Note: The file system may handle this automatically. Verify with a file listing.

    Rename Jules' Handover Brief:
        Action: Move and rename the file project/HANDOVER_BRIEF.md to project/reports/HANDOVER_BRIEF_JULES.md.

    Update All References (Critical):
        Action: This is the most important step. You must find all references to the old HANDOVER_BRIEF.md file and update them to point to the new path (project/reports/HANDOVER_BRIEF_JULES.md).
        Recommendation: Search for "HANDOVER_BRIEF.md" to get a complete list of files to edit. Based on my previous (now reverted) work, the files to check include:
            TRACE_INDEX.yml
            api/docs/reference/features/AUTOMATED_DOCUMENTATION_WORKFLOW.md
            project/PROJECT_REGISTRY.md
            project/archive/audit/AUDIT-PHASE-5.md
            project/logs/ACTIVITY.md
            project/logs/SESSION_LOG.md
            project/proposals/GOVERNANCE_AUDIT_REFACTOR.md
            project/reports/governance_demo_report.md
            scripts/doc-lint-rules.yml
            templates/PROJECT_REGISTRY.md
            verification/mandatory_logging.md

    Final Verification and Submission:
        Action: Once all files are moved and all references are updated, run the full linter. It should pass all governance checks and trigger the manifest regeneration.
        Action: Log the work.
        Action: Request a code review to confirm the changes are clean and correct.
        Action: Record this session.
        Action: Submit the final, focused changes to the api-phase-5d branch.

The project is now in a clean state, ready for this refactoring work to be completed correctly.
