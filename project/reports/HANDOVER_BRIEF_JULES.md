# Handover Brief: Implement Full Content-Level Traceability

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Author:** Jules
**Status:** âœ… Completed

## 1. Context
This work session focused on executing a comprehensive, repository-wide content alignment initiative. The primary goal was to establish an end-to-end traceability system, ensuring that every registered project artifact (code, documentation, etc.) is mapped to a canonical feature ID. This creates a fully linked and verifiable relationship between the project's backlog, high-level design, low-level design, and the alignment matrix.

This task followed a strict, example-first workflow where a "Backfill Trace Policy" was introduced and approved to handle legacy features that were implemented before the current backlog process was established.

## 2. Work Summary & Final Status
The core of the work involved systematically identifying untracked features, creating retrospective backlog items for them, and then weaving the new canonical IDs into all relevant governance and design documents.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **Applied "Backfill Trace Policy":** A new policy was followed to create canonical `FEAT-` style IDs for 13 foundational features and components that were previously only tracked by audit references (`AR-` IDs). This was the critical unblocking step for the entire process.

*   **Backlog & Design Document Updates:**
    *   `project/BACKLOG.md` was updated with 13 new retrospective entries (e.g., `FEAT-ZOTIFY-PLAYLISTS-01`, `FEAT-ZOTIFY-DATABASE-01`, `FEAT-ZOTIFY-GOVERNANCE-01`).
    *   `project/HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` and `project/LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` were updated with standardized trace blocks, linking each component to its new canonical ID, the backlog, the alignment matrix, and its code registry.

*   **Alignment Matrix Overhaul:** `project/ALIGNMENT_MATRIX.md` was significantly refactored. Rows corresponding to the updated features were replaced with more detailed entries that now include the new canonical IDs and direct links to the relevant design documents and backlog tasks. This completes the traceability loop.

*   **Generated Final Report:** A new report, `project/reports/CONTENT_ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md`, was created to summarize the alignment status of the project's 309 registered artifacts and provide a definitive list of the 13 backfilled canonical IDs for future reference.

### Final Status: Completed

The primary objective has been met. The repository's content is now fully aligned with the canonical trace model, providing a robust and verifiable foundation for future development and automated governance checks.

## 3. Next Immediate Steps

There are no immediate blockers. The project's documentation and governance layers are now in a highly consistent and stable state. The next developer can proceed with new feature work, following the established traceability patterns.

The following files were the most significantly modified during this task:
*   `project/BACKLOG.md`
*   `project/ALIGNMENT_MATRIX.md`
*   `project/HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md`
*   `project/LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md`
*   `project/reports/CONTENT_ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md` (newly created)
