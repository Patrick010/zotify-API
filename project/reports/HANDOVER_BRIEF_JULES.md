# Handover Brief: File & Directory Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-09-28
**Author:** Jules
**Status:** âœ… Completed

## 1. Context

The original task was a code hygiene and refactoring initiative. The primary goal was to clean up the project's file structure by moving and renaming specific documents and updating all internal references to reflect these changes.

This also involved a sub-task to standardize the filename of `governance_demo_report.md` to `GOVERNANCE_DEMO_REPORT.md` and update its references.

## 2. Work Summary & Final Status

All refactoring tasks described in the previous version of this document have been successfully completed.

*   All handover briefs were moved and renamed as required.
*   The `governance_demo_report.md` file was renamed to `GOVERNANCE_DEMO_REPORT.md`.
*   All internal references to the old filenames have been updated throughout the project.
*   The old, misnamed files have been deleted.
*   The project's unified linter was run successfully, and all project artifacts (`REPO_MANIFEST.md`, `TRACE_INDEX.yml`) have been correctly regenerated.

The repository is now in a clean, consistent state. There are no further actions required for this task.

## 3. Next Immediate Steps

None. This task is complete.
