# Governance Audit System: Demonstration Report

**Date:** 2025-09-27
**Author:** Jules

## 1. Purpose

This document provides a record of the live demonstration performed to validate the functionality of the refactored and strengthened governance audit system (`scripts/repo_inventory_and_governance.py`). The demonstration followed the procedure outlined in the `project/HANDOVER_BRIEF.md`.

## 2. Demonstration Steps & Outcomes

The demonstration was conducted in three phases: Detection, Correction, and Verification.

### Phase 1: Detection of an Unregistered File

1.  **Action:** A new, temporary Python file was created at `api/src/zotify_api/demo_test_file.py`. This file was intentionally left out of any index.

2.  **Action:** The governance audit script was executed:
    ```bash
    python3 scripts/repo_inventory_and_governance.py
    ```

3.  **Outcome:** The script correctly identified the new file as being untracked. The generated report (`project/reports/GOVERNANCE_AUDIT_REPORT.md`) contained the following entry, confirming successful detection:
    ```
    | `api/src/zotify_api/demo_test_file.py` | code | Missing Index | Expected in: `api/docs/CODE_FILE_INDEX.md` |
    ```

### Phase 2: Correction of the Violation

1.  **Action:** The violation was addressed by adding the new file to the appropriate index. A new entry was added to `api/docs/CODE_FILE_INDEX.md` for the demo file.

### Phase 3: Verification of the Fix

1.  **Action:** The governance audit script was executed again to verify the fix.
    ```bash
    python3 scripts/repo_inventory_and_governance.py
    ```
2.  **Initial Anomaly & Bug Fix:** The script initially failed to recognize the correction. A bug was identified in the script's `parse_markdown_index` function, which was incorrectly parsing file paths from markdown tables. This bug was corrected.

3.  **Final Outcome:** After fixing the bug and re-running the script, the system behaved as expected. The updated audit report now shows the demo file with an "OK" status, confirming that the registration is recognized correctly:
    ```
    | `api/src/zotify_api/demo_test_file.py` | code | OK |  |
    ```

## 3. Conclusion

The demonstration was successful. It verified that the enhanced governance audit system is fully functional and meets the requirements of the refactoring task. The system can reliably detect unregistered files, and once a violation is corrected, the script accurately reflects the updated status. The temporary file created for this demonstration will now be deleted.
