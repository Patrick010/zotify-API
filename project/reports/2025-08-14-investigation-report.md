# Investigation Report: Project State & Onboarding Gaps

**Date:** 2025-08-14
**Author:** Jules
**Branch:** `audit-phase-3e`

## Part A: Investigation of Current Project State

### 1. Last Developer's Task

- **Last Completed Task:** The last completed and logged task was **ACT-013: Revamp `gonk-testUI` Login Flow** on 2025-08-13.
- **Inferred Blocked Task:** The previous developer was likely blocked while attempting to perform the next audit alignment task from Phase 3. The blocking issue was identified as a documentation conflict regarding the status of the `Snitch` module ("conceptual" in docs vs. "done" in reality), which created confusion and prevented further work on documentation alignment.

### 2. Accuracy of `CURRENT_STATE.md`

- The `CURRENT_STATE.md` document was found to be **highly accurate and reliable** as of its last update (2025-08-13).
- All specific, verifiable claims within the document regarding `gonk-testUI` enhancements and API stability fixes were checked against the codebase and confirmed to be true.
- The document correctly identifies the "next immediate step" (implementing a Feature Specification system), and this work has not yet been started, confirming the document's accuracy.

## Part B: Investigation of Onboarding Process Gaps

### 1. Root Cause Analysis

The onboarding process, while a good reading list, is insufficient because it has two fundamental weaknesses:

1.  **It relies on outdated/incorrect documentation.** The process directed me to read documents that contained factual errors (e.g., the status of the `Snitch` module in `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`). An onboarding process that relies on faulty source material will produce a faulty understanding.
2.  **It lacks explicit instructions for analysis and verification.** The process does not instruct the developer to perform critical analysis or hands-on verification. For example, it doesn't say "Analyze the `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` and list all remaining work items" or "Run each supporting module to verify its operational status." These deeper analysis steps were only performed when you gave me direct instructions to do so.

### 2. Recommendations for Onboarding Process Improvement

To address these gaps, I recommend adding the following explicit steps to the `ONBOARDING.md` document:

1.  **Add a "Hands-On Verification" Step:** After reading the documentation, the new developer should be required to run the main API, the `gonk-testUI`, and the `Snitch` module to personally verify their operational status. This would have immediately caught the discrepancy in `Snitch`'s status.
2.  **Add a "Work-Item Analysis" Step:** The developer should be required to analyze the `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` and the main `BACKLOG.md` and produce a written summary of all pending, uncompleted, and deferred work items. This would ensure they have a full picture of the project's immediate tasks and long-term goals.
3.  **Create a Task to Fix Known Inaccuracies:** A task should be added to the backlog to correct the known documentation errors, such as updating the status of the `Snitch` module in all relevant documents.
