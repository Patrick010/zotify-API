**Task:** Finalize Phase 2 of the HLD/LLD Alignment Plan by implementing the background processing logic for the Downloads Subsystem and performing a comprehensive documentation update.

## Summary of Work

This task involved closing a known gap between the project's design documents and the codebase. The core of the work was to implement the processing logic for the in-memory download queue, which was previously only a stub. This implementation was the final step required to complete Phase 2 of the HLD/LLD Alignment Plan.

### Implemented Features & Changes

*   **Download Queue Logic:**
    *   Implemented the `process_download_queue` method in `DownloadsService` to process jobs, transitioning them from `pending` to `in_progress` and then to `completed` or `failed`.
    *   Added a new endpoint, `POST /api/download/process`, to manually trigger the queue processor. This endpoint is secured with the admin API key.
    *   Fixed a bug in the `retry_failed_jobs` logic to ensure that retried jobs are correctly re-queued.

*   **Testing:**
    *   Added a comprehensive suite of tests for the new download processing functionality, covering success, failure, and edge cases.
    *   Improved the existing retry test to confirm that a retried job can be successfully processed.
    *   All 149 tests in the project suite pass.

*   **Comprehensive Documentation Update:**
    *   Updated `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` to reflect the new implementation details of the Downloads Subsystem.
    *   Updated the `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` to mark the "Downloads Subsystem" implementation gap as partially closed (in-memory solution complete).
    *   Updated the `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md` to officially mark Phase 2 as finalized.
    *   Updated the `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` and `ROADMAP.md` to reflect the progress on background job management.
    *   Added a finalization summary to `AUDIT-phase-2.md` to conclude the phase.

## Task Checklist Compliance

The work was completed in strict accordance with the project's established processes and the user's direct instructions, ensuring that all code changes were immediately and thoroughly reflected in all relevant planning, design, and audit documents.
