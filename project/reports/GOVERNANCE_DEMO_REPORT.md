# Governance Script Demonstration Report

**Author:** Jules
**Date:** 2025-09-27

## 1. Introduction

This report documents a live demonstration of the refactored governance audit script, `scripts/repo_inventory_and_governance.py`. The purpose of this demonstration is to verify that the new script correctly identifies common compliance violations as defined in the "Refactor and Strengthen Governance Audit System" task.

The demonstration consists of two main tests:
1.  **Unregistered File Detection:** Verifying that the script can detect a new source file that has not been registered in the master code index.
2.  **Stub File Detection:** Verifying that the script can detect a new documentation file that contains placeholder content.

## 2. Baseline Audit

First, the script was run to establish a baseline report of the entire repository.

**Command:**
```bash
python3 scripts/repo_inventory_and_governance.py
```

**Result:**
The script successfully generated the report at `project/reports/GOVERNANCE_AUDIT_REPORT.md`. The report identified numerous pre-existing issues, which is expected given the new, stricter audit rules. This baseline confirms the script is operational.

## 3. Test 1: Unregistered File Detection

### 3.1. Action

A new, temporary Python file was created at `api/src/zotify_api/temp_demo_file.py`. This file was not registered in any index file.

**Command:**
```bash
touch api/src/zotify_api/temp_demo_file.py
```

### 3.2. Execution

The governance script was run again.

**Command:**
```bash
python3 scripts/repo_inventory_and_governance.py
```

### 3.3. Verification

The newly generated report was inspected. As expected, the script correctly identified the new file and flagged it as "Missing Index".

**Report Snippet:**
```markdown
| Path | File Type | Index(es) | Status |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
...
| `api/src/zotify_api/temp_demo_file.py` | code | api/docs/CODE_FILE_INDEX.md | Missing Index |
...
```

**Conclusion:** The test was successful. The script correctly detects unregistered code files.

## 4. Test 2: Stub File Detection

### 4.1. Action

A new, temporary Markdown file was created at `api/docs/temp_stub_file.md`. This file contained the keyword "TODO" to trigger the stub detection logic.

**Command:**
```bash
echo "# Temporary Stub File\n\nTODO: Add real content here." > api/docs/temp_stub_file.md
```

### 4.2. Execution

The governance script was run again.

**Command:**
```bash
python3 scripts/repo_inventory_and_governance.py
```

### 4.3. Verification

The newly generated report was inspected. As expected, the script correctly identified the new file and flagged it as both "Missing Index" and "Stub/Placeholder".

**Report Snippet:**
```markdown
| Path | File Type | Index(es) | Status |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
...
| `api/docs/temp_stub_file.md` | doc | api/docs/MASTER_INDEX.md | Missing Index, Stub/Placeholder |
...
```

**Conclusion:** The test was successful. The script correctly detects stub/placeholder files based on keyword content.
