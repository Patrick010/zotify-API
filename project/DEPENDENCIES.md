# Dependency Management Policy

This document outlines the policy for adding new third-party dependencies to the Zotify API project.

## Guiding Principles

The goal is to maintain a lean, stable, and secure project by minimizing the number of external dependencies. Each new dependency introduces potential security vulnerabilities, maintenance overhead, and licensing complexities.

## Policy for Adding New Dependencies

A new dependency may only be added to the project if it meets all of the following criteria:

1.  **Clear Necessity:** The dependency must provide significant value and solve a problem that cannot be reasonably solved with the existing standard library or current project dependencies.
2.  **Stability and Maintenance:** The dependency must be widely used, have a stable release (i.e., not in alpha or beta), and be actively maintained by its developers. A strong indicator of active maintenance is recent commit activity and timely responses to issues.
3.  **License Compatibility:** The dependency's license must be permissive (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD) and compatible with the project's overall licensing scheme.
4.  **Documentation:** The new dependency must be documented in this file, including its name, version, a link to its repository or website, and a brief justification for its inclusion.

## Approval Process

Any new dependency must be explicitly approved during a code review before it can be merged into the main branch.

## Current External Dependencies

*(This section will be populated as new dependencies are added and documented.)*
