# Logging System Traceability Matrix

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2025-08-15

## 1. Purpose

This document maps the high-level requirements for the new Extendable Logging System to the design artifacts that specify the solution and the backlog tasks that will implement it. This ensures that all requirements are met and provides end-to-end traceability for the feature.

## 2. Traceability Matrix

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Design Document(s) | Backlog Task(s) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **REQ-LOG-01** | A centralized, extendable logging service must be implemented. | [`LOGGING_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`](./LOGGING_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md) | `LOG-TASK-01` | **Proposed** |
| **REQ-LOG-02** | The system must support a pluggable handler architecture. | [`LOGGING_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`](./LOGGING_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md) | `LOG-TASK-02` | **Proposed** |
| **REQ-LOG-03** | An initial handler for system/debug logs (console output) must be provided. | [`LOGGING_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`](./LOGGING_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md) | `LOG-TASK-03` | **Proposed** |
| **REQ-LOG-04** | An initial handler for structured JSON audit logs must be provided. | [`LOGGING_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`](./LOGGING_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md) | `LOG-TASK-04` | **Proposed** |
| **REQ-LOG-05** | An initial handler for database-backed job logs must be provided. | [`LOGGING_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`](./LOGGING_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md) | `LOG-TASK-05` | **Proposed** |
| **REQ-LOG-06** | A comprehensive developer guide for using the system must be created. | [`LOGGING_GUIDE.md`](../api/docs/manuals/LOGGING_GUIDE.md) | `LOG-TASK-06` | **Proposed** |
| **REQ-LOG-07** | The requirement for structured logging must be mandated in the project's core process documents. | [`PID.md`](./PID.md) | `LOG-TASK-07` | **Proposed** |
| **REQ-LOG-08** | The implementation of the logging system must be tracked on the official project roadmap. | [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) | `LOG-TASK-07` | **Proposed** |
