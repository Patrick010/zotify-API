# Bootstrap Prompt: Project Onboarding

**Objective:** To bring any new developer fully up to speed on the Zotify API project.

**Instructions:**
Your primary goal is to gain a complete understanding of the project's current state, architecture, and processes. To do this, you must follow the "Recommended Onboarding Flow" outlined below, reviewing each document in the specified order. This sequential review is mandatory for efficient context restoration.

Upon completion, you will be fully aligned with the project's live status. At that point, please confirm you have completed the onboarding and await further instructions. Do not begin any development work until you receive a specific task.
