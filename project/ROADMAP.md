# Zotify API Platform Roadmap

**Date:** 2025-09-01
**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level, strategic roadmap for the Zotify API Platform. It is organized by project phase and outlines the development trajectory from the current stable state to future enhancements.

---

## 2. Project Phases

### Phase 1-2: Core Architecture & Refactoring (✅ Done)
This phase focused on establishing the foundational architecture of the project, including the initial API, database models, and provider abstractions.

### Phase 3: HLD/LLD Alignment (✅ Done)
This phase involved a comprehensive audit to align the High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD) with the implemented code, ensuring all documentation accurately reflects the state of the project.

### Phase 4: Enforcement & Automation (✅ Done)
This phase focused on hardening the development process by introducing and configuring a suite of static analysis tools (`ruff`, `mypy`), security scanners (`bandit`, `gosec`), and CI/CD pipeline improvements to enforce quality gates.

### Phase 5: Documentation & Process Hardening (✅ Done)
This phase focused on resolving outstanding documentation and process gaps that were identified during the audit. The `LOOSE_ENDS_BACKLOG.md` file was created, processed, and deleted, and several core process documents (`AGENTS.md`, `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`) were improved.

### Phase 6: Platform Extensibility (Planned)
This next major phase of work will focus on making the Zotify API a truly extensible platform, allowing the community to build and share new functionality.

- **Dynamic Plugin System:** Implement a dynamic plugin system for custom logging sinks and other components.
- **Providers as Plugins:** Refactor the existing providers to be standalone plugins.
- **External Integrations:** Develop reference implementations for Low-Code and Home Automation platforms.

### Phase 7: Snitch Module Hardening (Planned)
This phase will focus on implementing the security and reliability improvements for the Snitch module as defined in its project plan.

### Phase 8: Administrative & Fork-Specific Enhancements (Planned)
This phase will focus on implementing administrative APIs, settings, and other enhancements that improve the operational control and management of the platform.

- **Source:** `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` (Phases 6 & 9)

### Phase 9: Release Readiness (Planned)
This phase will focus on the final steps required to prepare for a stable, versioned release, including API versioning and packaging.

- **Source:** `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` (Phase 10)

## 4. Future Vision

Beyond the planned phases, development will focus on expanding the core feature set. See `FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md` for a full list of long-term ideas.
