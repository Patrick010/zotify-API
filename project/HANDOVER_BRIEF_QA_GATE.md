# Handover Brief: QA Gate Implementation

## 1. Context
This document outlines the context and next steps for a major project enhancement: the implementation of a new, professional-level QA Gate.

The project currently uses a simple, ad-hoc linter (`scripts/linter.py`) that enforces documentation-related rules. While effective for its narrow purpose, it does not perform any deep code quality analysis (e.g., complexity checks, mutation testing) and lacks comprehensive checks for documentation content and alignment.

A new, detailed specification has been provided to replace this system with a much more robust, multi-language QA Gate.

## 2. Objective
The overall objective is to implement the full QA Gate as defined in the user's specification. This will provide a professional, reliable, and transparent quality enforcement system for the entire repository.

## 3. Current Status & Plan
Given the large scope of the new QA Gate, the decision was made to implement it in a structured, phased approach. I have created a comprehensive, multi-phase plan that breaks down the work into manageable chunks.

This plan is located at: **`project/proposals/QA_GATE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`**.

I have also created a high-priority task in the `project/BACKLOG.md` to kick off this work.

## 4. Your Task: Begin Phase 1
Your first and most important task is to begin the implementation of **Phase 1: Python Code Quality Foundation** as detailed in the implementation plan.

**Key Steps for You:**
1.  **Read the Plan:** Thoroughly read and understand the new `project/proposals/QA_GATE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
2.  **Execute Phase 1:** Follow the tasks outlined in the "Phase 1" section of the plan. This includes:
    -   Creating the new `scripts/qa_gate.py` file.
    -   Installing new Python dependencies (`Radon`, `mutmut`).
    -   Implementing the Python-specific code quality checks.
    -   Creating placeholder helper scripts.
    -   Writing the new `QA_GATE.md` manual.

This work will form the foundation of the new QA system. Good luck.
