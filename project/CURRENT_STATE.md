# Project State as of 2025-08-12

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This document serves as a comprehensive snapshot of the current state of the Zotify API project. It provides historical context, a summary of recent accomplishments, known issues, and a clear definition of the next steps.

**It is a mandatory requirement on this project that all documentation, from architectural diagrams to operator guides, be treated as a 'live' artifact. All documentation must be kept in constant alignment with the codebase. This is not optional or open to interpretation; outdated documentation is considered a defect.**

**Furthermore, all significant changes, including but not limited to architectural refactors, feature additions, and process updates, must themselves be logged and reflected in the relevant project documentation (e.g., PID, HLD, LLD, CHANGELOG, etc.) as part of the implementation task.**

**To maintain clarity in the project's logs, any task that is postponed or paused must be moved from the Activity Log to the Backlog. This ensures the activity log remains a clear and accurate record of completed or actively in-progress work.**

The overarching goal of the recent work has been to execute a comprehensive audit and alignment of the project's documentation with its codebase, and to refactor the architecture to be more robust, maintainable, and scalable.

## 2. Current High-Level Goal

The project is currently in **Phase 3: Incremental Design Updates** of the HLD/LLD Alignment Plan.

The immediate goal is to **continue the gradual alignment of the High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD) documents with the actual state of the codebase.** This process is guided by the Traceability Matrix, which identifies all known deviations.

Work is performed incrementally, with a focus on updating the documentation for 1-2 subsystems at a time to reflect the ground truth of the implementation.

## 3. Recent Major Accomplishments

* **Terminology Refactor**: Renamed the "Provider Adapter" to "Provider Connector" across all code and documentation to improve terminological clarity.
* **Expanded Spotify Permissions**: The application now requests all available scopes from the Spotify API, enabling the broadest possible service functionality as per user requirements.
* **Provider Abstraction Layer Refactoring**: The application was successfully refactored from a Spotify-centric service to a provider-agnostic platform. The legacy Spotify client was replaced with a `SpotifyConnector` implementing a new `BaseProvider` interface.
* **Unified Database Architecture**: Refactored the persistence layer to use a unified, backend-agnostic database system built on **SQLAlchemy**, replacing previous ad-hoc storage mechanisms.
* **`gonk-testUI` Developer Tool**: Created a standalone developer tool to facilitate API testing and development.
* **System Documentation Overhaul**: Created comprehensive system documentation in the project documentation directories.
* **Establishment of Live Project Documents**: A new process has been established using live documents, including this snapshot, the Activity Log, the Project Registry, Lessons Learnt, and the Backlog.

## 4. Known Issues & Limitations

These issues relate to the development environment, not the application code:

* **File System Tool Unreliability**: Tools for file system manipulation have proven to be unreliable.
* **Test Runner Issues**: `pytest` has been difficult to configure correctly in this environment.

**Recommendation for next developer**: Be aware of these tool limitations.

## 5. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The immediate next step is to **review the Use Cases Gap Analysis to identify missing features and consult the Traceability Matrix to select the next development or alignment task.** The gap analysis now serves as the primary source of truth for feature coverage status.
