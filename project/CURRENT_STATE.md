# Project State as of 2025-08-17

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This document serves as a snapshot of the current state of the Zotify API project. This session focused on a comprehensive alignment of the codebase with the project's "living documentation."

## 2. Current High-Level Goal

The project is now in a fully documented and stable state. The primary feature work and documentation overhaul for this phase are complete. The project is ready for the next phase of development.

## 3. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session involved a multi-stage effort to resolve documentation discrepancies and restore missing artifacts.

*   **Logging System Integration:**
    *   An initial investigation revealed that the "New Logging System", previously thought to be unimplemented, was already present in the codebase.
    *   The `LoggingService` was successfully integrated into the application's startup lifecycle.
    *   The full test suite (133 tests) was run and confirmed to be passing after the integration.

*   **Documentation Overhaul & Correction:**
    *   A new canonical `ENDPOINTS.md` file was created and then completely rewritten using data generated from the codebase to ensure its accuracy.
    *   Several critical documents were restored from the project archive.
    *   The `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` was given a final, exhaustive audit and updated to include every single project document, as per the user's explicit list.
    *   All "living documentation" files (`ACTIVITY.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `AUDIT-PHASE-4.md`) have been updated to reflect all work performed.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   No known issues or blockers. The project is stable and the documentation is now believed to be fully aligned with the codebase.

## 5. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

There are no immediate pending tasks for this session. The project is ready to move on to the next set of requirements from the backlog.
