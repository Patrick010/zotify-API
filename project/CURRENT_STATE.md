# Project State as of 2025-08-17

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This document serves as a snapshot of the current state of the Zotify API project. This session focused on the implementation of a new, developer-facing Flexible Logging Framework.

## 2. Current High-Level Goal

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the new Flexible Logging Framework is complete and has been integrated into the application. The project is stable and ready for the next phase of development, which will likely involve extending the framework with more advanced features.

## 3. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session involved the ground-up implementation of a new logging system designed to be a core, developer-centric feature of the API framework.

*   **New Flexible Logging Framework (MVP):**
    *   **Core Service:** A new, asynchronous `LoggingService` was built to replace the previous, simpler implementation.
    *   **Configurable Sinks:** The MVP supports three types of log destinations ("sinks"), configurable via YAML: Console, File (with built-in rotation), and Webhook (for sending logs via HTTP POST).
    *   **Configuration as Code:** A new `api/logging_framework.yml` file was introduced to define sinks and triggers. The schema for this file is validated at runtime using Pydantic models.
    *   **Developer API:** A new `log_event()` function was created, providing developers with fine-grained, per-call control over a log's level, destinations, and structured metadata.
    *   **Runtime Reloading:** A new `POST /api/system/logging/reload` endpoint was added to allow administrators to reload the logging configuration without restarting the application.
    *   **Trigger System:** A basic trigger system was implemented, allowing specific log events to "forward" a new, transformed log event to designated sinks.

*   **Integration and Testing:**
    *   The new framework has been fully integrated into the application's startup sequence and the global `ErrorHandler`.
    *   A comprehensive suite of unit tests was written to validate all new functionality, from configuration parsing to log routing and trigger handling. All 138 tests are currently passing.

*   **Documentation:**
    *   A new, highly detailed `LOGGING_GUIDE.md` was created to serve as the developer's manual for the new framework.
    *   A `DEPENDENCIES.md` file was created to formalize the policy for adding new third-party libraries.
    - The documentation for the logging framework was further refactored to centralize the phased implementation plan into a new `LOGGING_PHASES.md` document.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   No known issues or blockers. The new feature is stable and the test suite is passing.

## 5. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

*   Plan the implementation for the next phases of the Flexible Logging Framework, which could include more advanced sink types (e.g., Syslog, message queues) and a more sophisticated trigger/action system.

**Primary Goal:** The "Documentation & Endpoint Canonicalization" task is now functionally complete, with the API itself being stable and fully documented.

**Current Status:**
*   âœ… The API has been successfully refactored to a consistent, canonical standard.
*   âœ… The API test suite (135 tests) is passing, validating the new structure.
*   âœ… All relevant API-level and project-level documentation has been updated.

**Blockers / Known Issues:**
*   ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL REGRESSION:** The `snitch.exe` helper application is non-functional due to the API changes. The CLI-based authentication flow is therefore broken.
*   ðŸŸ¡ **Build Issue:** The fix for `snitch` is blocked by an unresolved issue with the Go build process. The compiled executable does not reflect the latest source code changes, preventing the fix from being deployed. The root cause of the build failure is unknown.
