# Project State as of 2025-08-17

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This document serves as a snapshot of the current state of the Zotify API project. This session focused on a comprehensive alignment of the codebase with the project's "living documentation."

## 2. Current High-Level Goal

The project is now in a fully documented and stable state. The primary feature work and documentation overhaul for this phase are complete. The project is ready for the next phase of development.

## 3. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session involved a multi-stage effort to resolve documentation discrepancies and restore missing artifacts.

*   **Logging System Integration:**
    *   An initial investigation revealed that the "New Logging System", previously thought to be unimplemented, was already present in the codebase.
    *   The `LoggingService` was successfully integrated into the application's startup lifecycle.
    *   The full test suite (133 tests) was run and confirmed to be passing after the integration.

*   **Master Endpoint Reference (`ENDPOINTS.md`):**
    *   To address a compliance gap, a new canonical `ENDPOINTS.md` file was created to serve as a single source of truth for all API endpoints.
    *   This new document was registered in the `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`.

*   **Documentation Restoration & Audit:**
    *   Several critical documents referenced in `ENDPOINTS.md` were restored from the project archive, including `full_api_reference.md` and `PRIVACY_COMPLIANCE.md`.
    *   The `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` was given a full audit. All documentation files for the `api`, `snitch`, and `gonk-testUI` modules are now correctly registered.
    *   All "living documentation" files (`ACTIVITY.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `AUDIT-PHASE-4.md`) have been updated to reflect this work.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   No known issues or blockers. The project is stable.

## 5. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

There are no immediate pending tasks for this session. The project is ready to move on to the next set of requirements from the backlog.
