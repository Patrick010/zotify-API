# Project State as of 2025-08-17

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This document serves as a snapshot of the current state of the Zotify API project. This session focused on investigating the true state of the codebase, integrating a previously-implemented logging system, and correcting out-of-date project documentation.

## 2. Current High-Level Goal

The project's immediate goal is to finalize the integration of the **Extendable Logging System** and ensure all project documentation accurately reflects the state of the codebase.

## 3. Session Summary & Accomplishments

*   **Codebase Reality Check:**
    *   An investigation revealed that the "New Logging System", previously believed to be unimplemented, was already substantially complete within the codebase. This finding contradicted previous audit reports.
    *   The `test_new_logging_system.py` file was present and contained a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the new service.

*   **Logging System Integration (`LOG-TASK-01`):**
    *   The existing `LoggingService` was successfully integrated into the FastAPI application's startup lifecycle.
    *   The previous placeholder logging configuration (`logging.basicConfig`) was removed.
    *   A minor code style issue in the logging system's test file was corrected.

*   **Environment & Test Verification:**
    *   The test environment was stabilized by resolving dependency and Python environment issues.
    *   The full test suite (133 tests) was run and confirmed to be passing after the integration was complete, ensuring no regressions were introduced.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   No major blockers. The codebase is stable and the primary feature work is complete.
*   **Risk:** A significant portion of the project's "living documentation" was found to be out of sync with the codebase, posing a risk for future development. This session's work aims to mitigate this risk.

## 5. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The immediate next step is to complete the documentation overhaul by updating the final audit report (`AUDIT-PHASE-4.md`) and then preparing the work for submission. This will complete the work for this session.
