# Project State as of 2025-08-15

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This document serves as a snapshot of the current state of the Zotify API project following a session focused on hardening documentation, formalizing development processes, and designing a new logging system.

## 2. Current High-Level Goal

The project's near-term goal is the implementation of the newly designed **Extendable Logging System**. The long-term goal is to continue strengthening development processes and automated enforcement.

## 3. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session focused on process and documentation improvement, resulting in several key deliverables:

*   **Documentation Policy Hardening:**
    *   A deep analysis of the project's documentation was conducted, identifying the "living documentation" policy as the core standard.
    *   Several inconsistencies were resolved, including restoring the `TASK_CHECKLIST.md` from the archive and correcting its content.

*   **New Backlog Management Process:**
    *   A formal, structured process for managing the project backlog was implemented to ensure all tasks are traceable and well-defined before work begins.
    *   `BACKLOG.md` was updated with a new, mandatory task template.
    *   `PID.md` was updated with the formal rules for the new process.
    *   `TASK_CHECKLIST.md` was updated to include a manual verification step, enforcing the new process.

*   **Extendable Logging System (Design Complete):**
    *   A comprehensive design for a new, centralized, and extendable logging system was created.
    -   This was fully documented through the creation of `LOGGING_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`, `LOGGING_GUIDE.md`, and `LOGGING_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`.
    -   The project's `ROADMAP.md` and `BACKLOG.md` were updated to track the future implementation of this system.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   **Environment Instability:** The file system has shown instability, particularly with the file `./AUDIT-PHASE-4.md`, which could not be modified or deleted. A workaround was established by creating a new audit report file (`project/audit/AUDIT-PHASE-4a.md`).

## 5. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The immediate next step for the project is to begin implementation of the new **Extendable Logging System**. The design is complete, and the work has been broken down into detailed tasks, starting with `LOG-TASK-01`, which are now available in the `BACKLOG.md`.
