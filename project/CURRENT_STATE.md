Project State as of 2025-08-18

Status: Live Document
1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session began with a documentation verification task that evolved into a significant hardening of the project's test suite and runtime stability.

*   **Documentation Verified:** An initial verification confirmed that the project's extensive "living documentation" was an accurate reflection of the codebase, as claimed in the handover brief. A verification report was added to the audit log.

*   **Test Suite Hardened:** A full run of the test suite uncovered several latent bugs in the authentication module's unit tests. These issues, related to incorrect mocking, incomplete mock data, and flawed assertions, have all been fixed.

*   **Runtime Stability Improved:** Manual testing uncovered a critical runtime `TypeError` in the auth status endpoint due to unsafe timezone comparisons. This bug has been fixed, making the service more robust.

*   **Previous Accomplishments Confirmed:** The verification process also re-confirmed the significant work completed previously, including the `snitch` application repair, the hardening of the Flexible Logging Framework, and the formalization of new architectural proposals.

2. Known Issues & Blockers

There are no known bugs, regressions, or blockers. The test suite is 100% passing, and recently discovered runtime issues have been resolved. All assigned tasks for this session are complete.

3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The project is now in a highly stable, well-documented state. The next phase of work should focus on implementing the new architectural proposals:

*   Implement the Dynamic Plugin System for the logging framework as a proof-of-concept.
*   Begin the comprehensive documentation quality upgrade by refactoring key manuals to the new, higher standard.
