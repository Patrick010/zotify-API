# Project State as of 2025-08-17

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This document serves as a snapshot of the current state of the Zotify API project. This session focused on verifying the findings from a previous audit and formalizing the next steps for development.

## 2. Current High-Level Goal

The project's immediate goal is the implementation of the newly designed **Extendable Logging System**, as defined in `LOG-TASK-01`.

## 3. Session Summary & Accomplishments

*   **Audit Verification (Reality Check):**
    *   A verification of the key findings from the `AUDIT-PHASE-4.md` report was conducted and all findings were confirmed to be accurate.

*   **Backlog Formalization:**
    *   The `project/BACKLOG.md` was updated to remove obsolete tasks and add two new, high-priority tasks (`REM-TASK-01` and `LOG-TASK-01`).

*   **Environment & Documentation Remediation (`REM-TASK-01`):**
    *   The `.gitignore` file has been updated.
    *   The `INSTALLATION.md` guide has been corrected.
    *   The `ACTIVITY.md` log has been corrected.
    *   The Error Handler has been refactored for extensibility and its documentation has been updated. This completes the remediation task.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   No major blockers. The project is now in a stable state and ready for the implementation of the new logging system.

## 5. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The immediate next step for the project is to begin work on task **`LOG-TASK-01`** from the `BACKLOG.md`. This task covers the implementation of the new logging system.
