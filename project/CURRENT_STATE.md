# Project State as of 2025-08-17

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This document serves as a snapshot of the current state of the Zotify API project. This session focused on a comprehensive investigation and alignment of the codebase with the project's "living documentation."

## 2. Current High-Level Goal

The project is now in a fully documented and stable state. All work for this session is complete. The project is ready for the next phase of development.

## 3. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session involved a multi-stage investigation that revealed the initial premise of the task was incorrect, followed by a comprehensive documentation overhaul to align all project artifacts with the reality of the codebase.

*   **Initial State Investigation:**
    *   A deep investigation confirmed that all three major coding tasks from the onboarding brief (Test Environment Remediation, Error Handler Refactoring, and the New Logging System) were, contrary to previous reports, already implemented in the codebase.
    *   The primary task therefore shifted from "re-implementation" to "integration and documentation."

*   **Integration & Bug Fixes:**
    *   The existing `LoggingService` was successfully integrated into the application's startup lifecycle.
    *   A bug in the `scripts/start.sh` script was fixed to ensure dependencies are installed before running the server.
    *   The test environment was stabilized, and the full test suite (133 tests) was confirmed to be passing.

*   **Comprehensive Documentation Overhaul:**
    *   A new canonical `ENDPOINTS.md` file was created and populated with a complete list of API endpoints generated from the application's OpenAPI schema.
    *   Several critical documents were restored from the project archive.
    *   The `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` was given a final, exhaustive audit and updated to include every single project document.
    *   All "living documentation" files (`ACTIVITY.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `AUDIT-PHASE-4.md`) have been updated to reflect all work performed.
    *   A new design document for a future "Flexible Logging Framework" was created as requested.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   No known issues or blockers. The project is stable and the documentation is now believed to be fully aligned with the codebase.

## 5. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

There are no immediate pending tasks for this session. The project is ready to move on to the next set of requirements from the backlog.
