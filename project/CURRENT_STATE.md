Project State as of 2025-08-18

Status: Live Document
1. Session Summary & Accomplishments

This session began with a critical regression in the snitch helper application and evolved into a comprehensive hardening and strategic planning effort for the entire Zotify platform. All original and emergent issues have been resolved, and a clear strategic vision has been documented.

    snitch Application Repaired: A persistent and complex build issue was diagnosed and resolved by refactoring the application into a single, self-contained Go file. All related API bugs were also fixed, and the CLI authentication flow is now fully functional.

    Flexible Logging Framework Hardened:
        Security: Automatic redaction of sensitive data was implemented for production environments (APP_ENV=production).
        Flexibility: The framework was enhanced to support tag-based routing, allowing administrators to configure log flows in YAML without code changes.
        Audit Trail: A dedicated security.log was created, and the system now logs both successful and failed authentication attempts to provide a complete audit trail.

    Comprehensive Documentation Update: All project and module-level documentation (PID, HLD, LLD, Traceability Matrix, Logging Guide, snitch docs, etc.) has been updated to reflect the final, correct state of the codebase and its new features.

    Future Vision Formalized:
        Dynamic Plugin System: A formal proposal for a dynamic plugin architecture (DYNAMIC_PLUGIN_PROPOSAL.md) was created and integrated into the project's high-level design documents. This system is the designated successor to the current Provider Abstraction Layer.
        Low-Code Integration: A formal proposal for integrating with platforms like Node-RED (LOW_CODE_PROPOSAL.md) was created and documented.
        Home Automation Integration: A formal proposal for integrating with platforms like Home Assistant (HOME_AUTOMATION_PROPOSAL.md) was created and documented.

2. Known Issues & Blockers

    There are no known bugs or blockers. All assigned tasks for this session are complete.

3. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The project is now in a stable and well-documented state. The next phase of work should focus on implementing the new architectural proposals:

    Implement the Dynamic Plugin System for the logging framework as a proof-of-concept.
    Begin the comprehensive documentation quality upgrade by refactoring key manuals to the new, higher standard.
