# Project State as of 2025-08-15

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This document serves as a comprehensive snapshot of the current state of the Zotify API project. The primary goal of this session has been to debug a critical authentication bug and to design a new, platform-wide error handling system.

## 2. Current High-Level Goal

The project is currently focused on a major architectural improvement: the implementation of a **Generic Error Handling Module**. This work was preceded by a critical bug fix.

## 3. Session Summary & Accomplishments

*   **Authentication Timezone Bug (Fixed):**
    *   A recurring `500 Internal Server Error` was diagnosed and fixed. The root cause was the database layer stripping timezone information from `datetime` objects.
    *   The fix involved two parts:
        1.  Updating the SQLAlchemy model to be timezone-aware (`DateTime(timezone=True)`).
        2.  Making the authentication check service more resilient with a `try...except` block to gracefully handle any remaining legacy data.

*   **Generic Error Handling Module (Design Complete):**
    *   A comprehensive design for a new, centralized error handling module was created.
    *   This was fully documented with updates to the `PID`, `HLD`, `LLD`, and `ROADMAP`, and with the creation of new design documents and developer/operator guides.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   **Environment Instability:** The development environment became unstable during the session, with core tools (`pytest`, `ls`) hanging indefinitely.
*   **Forced Reset:** A `reset_all()` command was required to restore a functional environment. As a result, all in-progress implementation work for the Generic Error Handling Module was lost. The design and documentation work is preserved in session history and is being re-implemented.

## 5. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The immediate next step is to **re-implement the Generic Error Handling Module**, following the comprehensive 7-step plan that has been established. The current task is to re-create the documentation and design artifacts that were lost in the reset.
