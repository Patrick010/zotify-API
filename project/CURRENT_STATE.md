# Project State as of 2025-08-14

**Status:** Live Document

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This document serves as a comprehensive snapshot of the current state of the Zotify API project. It provides historical context, a summary of recent accomplishments, known issues, and a clear definition of the next steps.

**It is a mandatory requirement on this project that all documentation, from architectural diagrams to operator guides, be treated as a 'live' artifact. All documentation must be kept in constant alignment with the codebase. This is not optional or open to interpretation; outdated documentation is considered a defect.**

**Furthermore, all significant changes, including but not limited to architectural refactors, feature additions, and process updates, must themselves be logged and reflected in the relevant project documentation (e.g., PID, HLD, LLD, CHANGELOG, etc.) as part of the implementation task.**

**To maintain clarity in the project's logs, any task that is postponed or paused must be moved from the Activity Log to the Backlog. This ensures the activity log remains a clear and accurate record of completed or actively in-progress work.**

The overarching goal of the recent work has been to execute a comprehensive audit and alignment of the project's documentation with its codebase, and to refactor the architecture to be more robust, maintainable, and scalable.

## 2. Current High-Level Goal

The project is currently in a documentation and process refinement phase. The immediate goal is to fully integrate the `Snitch` and `Gonk-TestUI` supporting modules into the project's governance and documentation structure.

## 3. Recent Major Accomplishments

*   **`gonk-testUI` Enhancements**:
    *   The server is now fully configurable via command-line arguments (`--ip`, `--port`, `--api-url`).
    *   A persistent dark/light mode theme toggle with new icons has been added to improve usability.
    *   The UI layout has been improved to render API forms directly under the endpoint buttons.
    *   The Spotify authentication flow has been completely revamped to use a state-aware button, a popup window, and a robust polling mechanism, decoupling it from the backend.

*   **API Stability and Developer Experience Fixes**:
    *   Fixed a critical API startup crash caused by a missing CORS policy. The policy has been implemented and documented across all relevant project files.
    *   Improved the developer experience by providing a default `ADMIN_API_KEY` in development mode, preventing configuration-related startup errors.

*   **Documentation and Process Improvements**:
    *   **Completed HLD/LLD Documentation Alignment**: Finished the final tasks of the Phase 3 alignment plan, ensuring that the High-Level and Low-Level Design documents are fully consistent with the current state of the codebase.
    *   Corrected several inconsistencies in the project's traceability matrices and audit logs.
    *   Established a new convention for unique filenames and added a sequencing mechanism to the `ACTIVITY.md` log.

*   **Terminology Refactor**: Renamed the "Provider Adapter" to "Provider Connector".
*   **Provider Abstraction Layer Refactoring**: Refactored the application to a provider-agnostic platform.
*   **Unified Database Architecture**: Refactored the persistence layer to use SQLAlchemy.

## 4. Known Issues & Limitations

These issues relate to the development environment, not the application code:

*   **File System Tool Unreliability**: Tools for file system manipulation (`rename_file`) have proven to be unreliable.
*   **Recursive Commands**: Recursive shell commands (`ls -R`, `grep -r`) have been observed to time out, requiring manual, level-by-level investigation as a workaround.
*   **Test Runner Issues**: `pytest` has been difficult to configure correctly in this environment.

**Recommendation for next developer**: Be aware of these tool limitations.

## 5. Pending Work: Next Immediate Steps

The immediate next step is to **implement the new Feature Specification documentation system**, as outlined in the multi-part plan. This involves creating the new file structure (`docs/reference/FEATURE_SPECS.md`), integrating it into the project governance documents, and then retroactively documenting all existing features of the Core API and Supporting Modules.
