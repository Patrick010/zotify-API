    "content": "# Changelog\n\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),\nand this project adheres to a custom versioning scheme for pre-releases.\n\n## [Unreleased]\n\n### Added\n- **New Logging System**: Implemented a new, robust logging service that is fully configurable via `logging_config.yml`.\n  - Includes a `ConsoleHandler` for standard output.\n  - Includes a `JsonAuditHandler` for writing structured audit logs to a file.\n  - Includes a `DatabaseJobHandler` for persisting the status of long-running jobs to the database.\n\n### Changed\n- **Error Handler Extensibility**: Refactored the error handling module's action system. Actions are now discovered dynamically from files in the `actions/` directory, making the system fully extensible without modifying core code.\n\n### Fixed\n- **Test Suite Stability**: Resolved persistent `OperationalError` failures in the download-related tests by refactoring the faulty, module-level database setup in `test_download.py` to use the standardized, function-scoped fixtures from `conftest.py`.\n- **Test Environment Consistency**: Corrected a critical import-order issue related to SQLAlchemy model registration by ensuring the `models.py` module is loaded before `Base.metadata.create_all()` is called within the test database fixture. This fixed `no such table` errors for all tests.\n\n---\n## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-12\n\nThis is the initial documented release, capturing the state of the Zotify API after a series of major architectural refactorings.\n\n### Added\n\n-   **API Feature Set:**\n    -   Spotify Authentication via OAuth2, including token refresh, and secure callback handling.\n    -   Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for Playlists.\n    -   Full CRUD operations for Tracks (database-only, metadata is separate).\n    -   Persistent Download Queue system to manage and track download jobs.\n    -   API for searching content via the configured provider.\n    -   Endpoints for synchronizing playlists and library data from Spotify.\n    -   System endpoints for monitoring application status, configuration, and logs.\n    -   Webhook system for sending outbound notifications on application events.\n-   **Developer Experience:**\n    -   `gonk-testUI`: A standalone developer UI for easily testing all API endpoints.\n    -   Comprehensive Project Documentation, including live status documents, developer guides, and a project registry.\n    -   Default `DATABASE_URI` configuration to allow the application to run out-of-the-box for local development.\n\n### Changed\n\n-   **Unified Database:** All application data (including Spotify tokens, playlists, tracks, and download jobs) was migrated to a single, unified database backend using SQLAlchemy. This replaced multiple ad-hoc storage mechanisms (JSON files, in-memory dicts).\n-   **Provider Abstraction Layer:** The architecture was refactored to be provider-agnostic. The Spotify-specific client was refactored into a stateless `SpotiClient` used by a `SpotifyConnector` that implements a generic `BaseProvider` interface.\n\n### Fixed\n\n-   Resolved a series of cascading `ImportError` and `ModuleNotFoundError` issues at startup caused by an incomplete refactoring of the authentication and provider systems. The application now starts cleanly.\n\n### Removed\n\n-   Removed the old file-based storage system for Spotify tokens (`spotify_tokens.json`).\n-   Removed the mandatory environment variable check for `DATABASE_URI` from `start.sh` in favor of a development default.\n",

    "content": "# Zotify API - Developer Guide\n\nThis guide provides developers with the necessary information to run, test, and contribute to the Zotify API locally.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Local Development Setup\n\n### Purpose\nTo create a consistent and isolated local environment for developing and testing the Zotify API.\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Python 3.10+\n- `pip` for package installation\n- Git\n- An accessible database (SQLite is sufficient for local development)\n\n### Setup Steps\n\n1.  **Clone the Repository**\n    \\`\\`\\`bash\n    git clone https://github.com/Patrick010/zotify-API.git\n    cd zotify-API\n    \\`\\`\\`\n\n2.  **Install Dependencies**\n    It is crucial to use a virtual environment.\n    \\`\\`\\`bash\n    python3 -m venv venv\n    source venv/bin/activate\n    pip install -e ./api\n    \\`\\`\\`\n\n3.  **Set Up Local Environment**\n    The application uses a `.env` file for configuration. Copy the example and fill in your details.\n    \\`\\`\\`bash\n    # From the /api directory\n    cp .env.example .env\n    # Edit .env to set your local configuration.\n    nano .env\n    \\`\\`\\`\n    **Required `.env` variables for local development:**\n    \\`\\`\\`\n    APP_ENV=\"development\"\n    ADMIN_API_KEY=\"dev_key\"\n    DATABASE_URI=\"sqlite:///storage/zotify.db\"\n    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=\"your_spotify_client_id\"\n    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=\"your_spotify_client_secret\"\n    SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/spotify/callback\"\n    \\`\\`\\`\n\n4.  **Create Storage Directory & Database**\n    The application will create the database file on first run, but the directory must exist.\n    \\`\\`\\`bash\n    # From the /api directory\n    mkdir -p storage\n    \\`\\`\\`\n\n---\n\n## 2. Running and Testing\n\n### Purpose\nTo run the API server locally with hot-reloading for active development and to execute the full test suite.\n\n### 2.1. Run the API Locally\n#### Command\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n# Run from the /api directory\nuvicorn zotify_api.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000\n\\`\\`\\`\n#### Expected Output\n\\`\\`\\`\nINFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)\nINFO:     Started reloader process [12345] using StatReload\nINFO:     Started server process [12347]\nINFO:     Waiting for application startup.\nINFO:     Application startup complete.\n\\`\\`\\`\n#### Usage Notes\n- The interactive OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`. This is the best way to explore and test endpoints during development.\n\n### 2.2. Run the Test Suite\n#### Command\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n# Run from the /api directory\nAPP_ENV=test python3 -m pytest\n\\`\\`\\`\n#### Usage Notes\n- `APP_ENV=test` is **required**. It configures the app to use an in-memory SQLite database and other test-specific settings, preventing interference with your development database.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Local API Interaction Examples\n\n### Purpose\nTo provide practical `curl` examples for interacting with a locally running instance of the API.\n\n### 3.1. Health Check\n#### Command\n\\`\\`\\`bash\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health\n\\`\\`\\`\n#### Expected Response\n\\`\\`\\`json\n{\n  \"status\": \"ok\"\n}\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### 3.2. Add a Track to the Download Queue\n#### Command\n\\`\\`\\`bash\ncurl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/download \\\n  -H \"X-API-Key: dev_key\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"track_ids\": [\"spotify:track:4cOdK2wGLETOMsV3oDPEhB\"]}'\n\\`\\`\\`\n#### Expected Response\nA JSON array with the created job object(s).\n\\`\\`\\`json\n[\n  {\n    \"job_id\": \"some-uuid-string\",\n    \"track_id\": \"spotify:track:4cOdK2wGLETOMsV3oDPEhB\",\n    \"status\": \"pending\",\n    \"progress\": 0.0,\n    \"created_at\": \"...\",\n    \"error_message\": null\n  }\n]\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### 3.3. Check Download Queue Status\n#### Command\n\\`\\`\\`bash\ncurl -X GET \"http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/download/status\" -H \"X-API-Key: dev_key\"\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### Troubleshooting\n- **`ModuleNotFoundError: zotify_api`**: You are likely in the wrong directory. Ensure you run `uvicorn` and `pytest` from the `/api` directory.\n- **`401 Unauthorized`**: Ensure you are passing the `X-API-Key` header and that its value matches the `ADMIN_API_KEY` in your `.env` file.\n- **`500 Internal Server Error`**: Check the `uvicorn` server logs for a full traceback. This often points to a misconfiguration or a bug.\n\n### References\n- **API Documentation:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`\n- **Operator Manual:** `OPERATOR_MANUAL.md`\n- **Error Handling Guide:** `ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md`\n",

    "content": "# Developer Guide: Generic Error Handling Module\n\n**Status:** Implemented\n**Author:** Jules\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis guide explains how to work with the Generic Error Handling Module. This module is the centralized system for processing all unhandled exceptions. All developers working on the Zotify API platform should be familiar with its operation.\n\n## 2. Core Concepts\n\n-   **Automatic Interception:** You do not need to wrap your code in `try...except` blocks for general error handling. The module automatically catches all unhandled exceptions from API endpoints, background tasks, and other services.\n-   **Standardized Output:** All errors are automatically formatted into a standard JSON response for APIs or a plain text format for other contexts. Your code should not return custom error formats.\n\n## 3. Manually Triggering the Error Handler\n\nIn some cases, you may want to handle an exception but still report it to the central handler for logging and trigger processing. You can do this by injecting the `ErrorHandler` singleton and calling it directly.\n\n```python\nfrom zotify_api.core.error_handler import get_error_handler\n\nasync def some_function():\n    handler = get_error_handler()\n    try:\n        # Some fallible operation\n        result = await some_api_call()\n    except SomeExpectedException as e:\n        # Perform some local cleanup\n        await handler.handle_exception_async(e, context={\"user_id\": \"123\"})\n        # Return a custom, safe response to the user\n        return {\"status\": \"failed_safely\"}\n```\n\n## 4. Extending the Module\n\nThe module is designed to be extensible without modifying its core code.\n\n### 4.1. Adding Custom Triggers\n\nThe trigger/action system allows you to automate responses to specific errors. This is configured entirely through the `error_handler_config.yaml` file.\n\n**To add a new trigger:**\n1.  Identify the full path of the exception type you want to catch (e.g., `sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError`).\n2.  Add a new entry to the `triggers` list in `error_handler_config.yaml`.\n3.  Define one or more actions to be executed.\n\n**Example:**\n```yaml\ntriggers:\n  - exception_type: sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError\n    actions:\n      - type: log_critical\n        message: \"Database integrity violation detected!\"\n```\n\n### 4.2. Adding a New Action Type\n\nThe system is now fully extensible. Adding a new action requires no modification of the core `TriggerManager`.\n\n1.  Create a new Python file in the `src/zotify_api/core/error_handler/actions/` directory. The name of the file will be the `type` of your action (e.g., `send_sms.py` would create an action of type `send_sms`).\n2.  In that file, create a class that inherits from `zotify_api.core.error_handler.actions.base.BaseAction`. The class name should be the PascalCase version of the filename (e.g., `SendSms`).\n3.  Implement the `run(self, context: dict)` method. The `context` dictionary contains the original exception and the action configuration from the YAML file.\n\n**Example `.../actions/send_sms.py`:**\n```python\nimport logging\nfrom .base import BaseAction\n\nlog = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\nclass SendSms(BaseAction):\n    def run(self, context: dict):\n        \"\"\"\n        A custom action to send an SMS notification.\n        \"\"\"\n        exc = context.get(\"exception\")\n        action_config = context.get(\"action_config\") # Details from the YAML\n\n        phone_number = action_config.get(\"phone_number\")\n        if not phone_number:\n            log.error(\"SMS action is missing 'phone_number' in config.\")\n            return\n\n        message = f\"Critical error detected: {exc}\"\n        log.info(f\"Sending SMS to {phone_number}: {message}\")\n        # In a real implementation, you would use a service like Twilio here.\n```\n\nThe `TriggerManager` will automatically discover and load your new action at startup. You can then use the action `type` (e.g., `send_sms`) in your `error_handler_config.yaml`.\n\n## 5. Best Practices\n\n-   **Don't Swallow Exceptions:** Avoid generic `except Exception:` blocks that hide errors. Let unhandled exceptions propagate up to the global handler.\n-   **Use Specific Exceptions:** When raising your own errors, use specific, descriptive exception classes rather than generic `Exception`. This makes it easier to configure triggers.\n-   **Provide Context:** When manually handling an exception, pass any relevant contextual information (e.g., user ID, job ID, relevant data) to the `handle_exception` method. This will be invaluable for debugging.\n",

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, ahe GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\n  and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n",

    "content": "# Zotify API - Operator Manual\n\nThis manual provides detailed, actionable guidance for deploying, configuring, and maintaining the Zotify API in a production environment.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Deployment Process\n\n### Purpose\nThis section outlines the complete process for deploying the Zotify API server from the source code. It covers everything from cloning the repository to running the application with a process manager for production use.\n\n### Command / Example\nA typical deployment consists of the following sequence of commands, executed from the server's command line:\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n# 1. Clone the repository from GitHub\ngit clone https://github.com/Patrick010/zotify-API.git\ncd zotify-API\n\n# 2. Set up a dedicated Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies\npython3 -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\n\n# 3. Install the application and its dependencies in editable mode\npip install -e ./api\n\n# 4. Create required storage directories for the database and logs\nmkdir -p api/storage\n\n# 5. Create and populate the environment configuration file (see Configuration section)\n# nano api/.env\n\n# 6. Run the application server using a process manager like systemd (see below)\n# For a quick foreground test, you can run uvicorn directly:\n# uvicorn zotify_api.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### Usage Notes\n- **User Permissions:** Ensure the user running the API has read/write permissions for the `api/storage` directory.\n- **Production Server:** For production, it is strongly recommended to run `uvicorn` behind a reverse proxy like Nginx and manage the process using `systemd`. This provides SSL termination, load balancing, and process resilience.\n- **Firewall:** Ensure the port the API runs on (e.g., 8000) is accessible from the reverse proxy, but not necessarily from the public internet.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Uvicorn Process Management\n\n### Purpose\nRun the Zotify API service using `uvicorn` for local development or production deployment.\n\n### Command\n\\`\\`\\`bash\nuvicorn zotify_api.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --workers 4\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### Parameters / Flags\n| Parameter/Flag        | Description                                                                                             | Notes                                                                                                                              |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `zotify_api.main:app` | The Python import path to the FastAPI `app` instance.                                                   | A required positional argument for uvicorn.                                                                                        |\n| `--host <ip>`         | The IP address to bind the server to.                                                                   | Use `127.0.0.1` for production (to be accessed via reverse proxy).

For `systemd`, ensure the `EnvironmentFile` path is correct.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Maintenance\n\n### Purpose\nRegular maintenance tasks to ensure the health and stability of the Zotify API.\n\n### 3.1. Database Backup\n\n#### Command\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n# For PostgreSQL\npg_dump -U <db_user> -h <db_host> <db_name> > zotify_backup_$(date +%F).sql\n\n# For SQLite\nsqlite3 /path/to/api/storage/zotify.db \".backup /path/to/backup/zotify_backup_$(date +%F).db\"\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n#### Usage Notes\n- This command should be run regularly via a `cron` job.\n- Store backups in a secure, remote location.\n\n### 3.2. Log Rotation\n\n#### Purpose\nThe `json_audit.log` can grow indefinitely. Log rotation prevents it from consuming excessive disk space.\n\n#### Command / Example\nConfigure `logrotate` by creating a file at `/etc/logrotate.d/zotify`:\n\\`\\`\\`\n/path/to/api/storage/audit.log {\n    daily\n    rotate 7\n    compress\n    missingok\n    notifempty\n    create 0640 your_user your_group\n}\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n#### Usage Notes\n- This configuration rotates the log daily, keeps 7 compressed archives, and safely handles a missing log file.\n- Adjust `daily`, `rotate`, and permissions as needed.\n\n### References\n- [Uvicorn Deployment Guide](https://www.uvicorn.org/deployment/)\n- [Logrotate Man Page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/logrotate.8.html)\n",

    "content": "# Spotify Provider Connector\n\nThis document describes the implementation of the Spotify provider connector, which is the first provider to be integrated into the new provider-agnostic architecture.\n\n## Module Location\n\n`api/src/zotify_api/providers/spotify_connector.py`\n\n## Interface Implementation\n\nThe `SpotifyConnector` class implements the `BaseProvider` interface defined in `base.py`. It provides concrete implementations for all the abstract methods, such as `search`, `get_playlist`, etc.\n\n## Key Dependencies\n\n-   **`SpotiClient`**: The connector uses the `SpotiClient` to make the actual calls to the Spotify Web API. The `SpotiClient` is provided to the connector via the `get_spoti_client` dependency, which ensures that it is always initialized with a valid, non-expired access token.\n-   **Database Session**: The connector receives a database session, which it uses to interact with the database via the CRUD layer (e.g., for syncing playlists).\n\n## Provider-Specific Quirks & Limitations\n\n-   **Authentication**: The current authentication flow is specific to Spotify's OAuth 2.0 implementation with PKCE. A more generic authentication manager will be needed to support other providers with different authentication mechanisms.\n-   **Data Models**: The current database models are closely based on the data returned by the Spotify API. A future iteration will involve creating more normalized, provider-agnostic Pydantic schemas, and the connector will be responsible for translating between the Spotify API format and the normalized format.\n-   **Rate Limiting**: The connector does not currently implement any specific rate limiting logic. It relies on the `SpotiClient`'s basic retry mechanism.\n",

    "content": "# Feature Spec: Authentication - Admin API Key\n\n**Status:** Implemented & Live\n\n---\n\n**1. Feature Name:**\nAuthentication via Static Admin API Key\n\n**2. Module/Component:**\nCore API\n\n**3. Purpose / Business Value:**\nProvides a simple, effective security mechanism to protect all API endpoints from unauthorized access. This ensures that only trusted clients or users can interact with the API, preventing public abuse and unauthorized data access.\n\n**4. Description of Functionality:**\nThe system protects all API endpoints by requiring a valid, secret API key to be passed in the `X-API-Key` HTTP header of every request. If the key is missing or invalid, the API returns a `401 Unauthorized` error.\n\n**5. Technical Details:**\n- The API uses FastAPI's `APIKeyHeader` dependency to define the security scheme.\n- A global dependency, `require_admin_api_key`, is applied to all necessary routes (or globally).\n- This dependency checks the provided `X-API-Key` header against the `admin_api_key` value stored in the application's configuration.\n- For developer convenience, if the application is run in `development` mode without an `ADMIN_API_KEY` set in the environment, a default key (`test_key`) is used automatically. In `production` mode, the key must be explicitly set, or the application will fail to start.\n\n**6. Associated Endpoints or Functions:**\n- This security scheme is applied globally to all endpoints under the `/api/` prefix.\n- Key function: `zotify_api.services.auth.require_admin_api_key`\n\n**7. Inputs:**\n- **Header:** `X-API-Key`\n- **Data Type:** `string`\n- **Constraints:** Must be a non-empty string matching the configured server-side key.\n\n**8. Outputs:**\n- **Success:** The request is processed normally.\n- **Error:** HTTP `401 Unauthorized` with `{\"detail\": \"Invalid or missing API Key\"}`.\n\n**9. Dependencies:**\n- **External Libraries:** `fastapi`\n- **Modules:** `zotify_api.config`, `zotify_api.services.auth`\n\n**10. Supported Configurations:**\n- The API key can be configured via an environment variable (`ADMIN_API_KEY`).\n- In production, it can also be read from a file (`.admin_api_key`).\n\n**11. Examples:**\n**Example cURL Request:**\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"http://localhost:8000/api/system/uptime\" -H \"X-API-Key: your_secret_api_key\"\n```\n\n**12. Edge Cases / Limitations:**\n- This is a static, shared-secret system. It does not provide user-level authentication or role-based access control.\n- The key is transmitted in a header and relies on TLS for protection against snooping.\n- There is no built-in mechanism for key rotation; the key must be changed manually in the environment or config file.\n\n**13. Testing & Validation Notes:**\n- Tests for protected endpoints should include cases with a valid key, an invalid key, and no key to verify that the `401` error is returned correctly.\n- The `api/tests/conftest.py` likely contains fixtures for providing the test client with a valid API key.\n\n**14. Related Documentation:**\n- `project/SECURITY.md` (describes the overall security model)\n- `project/LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` (mentions the dependency injection for security)\n- `project/FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md` (lists JWT as a future improvement)\n",

    "content": "# Proposal: Feature Specification for Provider-Agnostic Extensions\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis proposal extends the existing provider-agnostic design of the API by ensuring all features, endpoints, and modules\u2014current and future\u2014are documented with a consistent, detailed, and discoverable specification. While the API can already work across multiple providers, there is currently no formalized structure for documenting the expected behavior, capabilities, and metadata handling of each provider integration.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Scope\n\nThis applies to:\n\n- Core API endpoints that interact with any provider.\n- Supporting modules (Snitch, Gonk-TestUI, and similar).\n- Future enhancements or integrations with additional audio providers.\n\nAll features, whether provider-specific or provider-agnostic, must have a clear specification entry.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Motivation\n\nCurrently, new provider integrations are added with inconsistent documentation. Developers, maintainers, and auditors must reverse-engineer behavior or metadata coverage. Formalizing specifications ensures clarity, traceability, and consistent expectations across all provider integrations.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Feature Specification Structure\n\nEach feature\u2014core or provider-agnostic extension\u2014must include:\n\n- **Feature Name**\n- **Module/Component**\n- **Purpose / Business Value**\n- **Description of Functionality**\n- **Technical Details** (logic, workflows, algorithms, and provider-specific nuances)\n- **Associated Endpoints or Functions**\n- **Inputs & Outputs**\n- **Dependencies**\n- **Supported Configurations** (formats, codecs, provider-specific options)\n- **Examples** (CLI, API requests, provider scenarios)\n- **Edge Cases / Limitations**\n- **Testing & Validation Notes**\n- **Related Documentation** (cross-links to HLD, LLD, FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Integration with Provider-Agnostic Architecture\n\n- Clearly indicate which features are provider-agnostic and which extend or depend on specific provider capabilities.\n- Include metadata coverage and supported capabilities for each provider in the specification.\n- Provide a \u201cprovider adapter interface\u201d reference for features that interact with multiple providers.\n- Document variations in behavior or limitations per provider.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Implementation Plan\n\n1. Create a dedicated section in the documentation tree:\n\ndocs/reference/FEATURE_SPECS.md\ndocs/reference/features/\naudio_processing.md\nwebhooks.md\nprovider_extensions.md\n\n\n2. Retroactively document all existing provider integrations with detailed feature specifications.\n3. Ensure every new feature or provider integration has its spec entry before or at implementation.\n4. Include cross-links to:\n\n- `ENDPOINTS.md`\n- `SYSTEM_SPECIFICATIONS.md`\n- `ROADMAP.md`\n- `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`\n\n5. Reference `FEATURE_SPECS.md` in `PID.md`, `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`, and other dev-flow documents.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Metadata & Capability Matrix\n\nFor provider-agnostic features extended to multiple providers, include a table that shows:\n\n- Supported metadata fields per provider\n- Supported operations (playlists, tracks, albums, encoding options)\n- Any provider-specific limitations or differences\n\n---\n\n## 8. Pre-Merge Checks\n\n- CI/CD pipeline must enforce that any new provider feature includes a completed spec entry.\n- Missing metadata coverage or incomplete specifications block merges.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Testing & Validation\n\n- Standardized test suite should validate:\n\n- Feature behavior against all supported providers\n- Metadata completeness and accuracy\n- Correct operation of provider adapter interface\n\n---\n\n## 10. Enforcement & Maintenance\n\n- Treat `FEATURE_SPECS.md` as a live document.\n- Quarterly reviews to catch gaps or outdated specifications.\n- Continuous integration ensures alignment with provider capabilities.\n\n---\n\n## 11. Developer Guidance\n\n- When extending the API with new provider features, follow the existing provider-agnostic interface.\n- Document differences, limitations, or provider-specific configurations in the spec entry.\n- Ensure examples cover all supported providers.\n\n---\n\n## 12. Auditing & Traceability\n\n- Features linked to providers and metadata coverage are fully traceable via `FEATURE_SPECS.md`.\n- Auditors can immediately understand capabilities without reverse-engineering code.\n\n---\n\n## 13. Future-Proofing\n\n- Specifications include placeholders for planned provider enhancements.\n- The \u201cprovider adapter interface\u201d ensures new providers can be added consistently.\n- Metadata and capability tables prevent drift between API behavior and documentation.\n\n---\n\n## 14. Outcome\n\n- Every feature and provider extension has a discoverable, complete, and up-to-date specification.\n- Developers can confidently implement, extend, and audit provider-agnostic features.\n- Maintenance and onboarding complexity is reduced.\n\n---\n\n## 15. References\n\n- `ENDPOINTS.md`\n- `SYSTEM_SPECIFICATIONS.md`\n- `ROADMAP.md`\n- `FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md` (includes provider-agnostic extension tasks)\n- `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`\n",

    "content": "# Generic Error Handling Module - Design Specification\n\n**Status:** Proposed\n**Author:** Jules\n**Related Documents:** `HLD.md`, `LLD.md`, `ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md`\n\n## 1. Overview\n\nThis document provides the detailed technical design for the Generic Error Handling Module. This module serves as the central, platform-wide mechanism for intercepting, processing, logging, and responding to all unhandled exceptions.\n\n## 2. Core Components & Class Structure\n\nThe module will be located at `api/src/zotify_api/core/error_handler/` and will consist of the following key components:\n\n### 2.1. `ErrorHandler` (in `main.py`)\n\nThis is the central class of the module, designed as a singleton.\n\n```python\nclass ErrorHandler:\n    def __init__(self, config: ErrorHandlerConfig, logger: Logger):\n        # ...\n\n    def handle_exception(self, exc: Exception, context: dict = None):\n        # Main processing logic\n        # 1. Determine error category (e.g., API, Internal, Provider)\n        # 2. Generate standardized error response using a formatter\n        # 3. Log the error with full traceback\n        # 4. Check for and execute any configured triggers\n\n    async def handle_exception_async(self, exc: Exception, context: dict = None):\n        # Async version for use in async contexts\n```\n\n### 2.2. `IntegrationHooks` (in `hooks.py`)\n\nThis file will contain the functions to wire the `ErrorHandler` into the application.\n\n```python\ndef register_fastapi_hooks(app: FastAPI, handler: ErrorHandler):\n    # Adds a Starlette exception middleware to the FastAPI app.\n    # This middleware will catch all exceptions from the API layer\n    # and pass them to handler.handle_exception_async().\n\ndef register_system_hooks(handler: ErrorHandler):\n    # Sets sys.excepthook to a function that calls handler.handle_exception().\n    # This catches all unhandled exceptions in synchronous, non-FastAPI code.\n\n    # Sets the asyncio event loop's exception handler to a function\n    # that calls handler.handle_exception_async().\n    # This catches unhandled exceptions in background asyncio tasks.\n```\n\n### 2.3. `Configuration` (in `config.py`)\n\nThis file defines the Pydantic models for the module's configuration, which will be loaded from a YAML file.\n\n```python\nclass ActionConfig(BaseModel):\n    type: Literal[\"log_critical\", \"webhook\"]\n    # ... action-specific fields (e.g., webhook_url)\n\nclass TriggerConfig(BaseModel):\n    exception_type: str  # e.g., \"requests.exceptions.ConnectionError\"\n    actions: list[ActionConfig]\n\nclass ErrorHandlerConfig(BaseModel):\n    verbosity: Literal[\"debug\", \"production\"] = \"production\"\n    triggers: list[TriggerConfig] = []\n```\n\n## 3. Standardized Error Schema\n\nAll errors processed by the module will be formatted into a standard schema before being returned or logged.\n\n### 3.1. API Error Schema (JSON)\n\nFor API responses, the JSON body will follow this structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"E1001\",\n    \"message\": \"An internal server error occurred.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-08-14T14:30:00Z\",\n    \"request_id\": \"uuid-...\",\n    \"details\": {\n      // Optional, only in debug mode\n      \"exception_type\": \"ValueError\",\n      \"exception_message\": \"...\",\n      \"traceback\": \"...\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3.2. CLI/Log Error Format (Plain Text)\n\nFor non-API contexts, errors will be logged in a structured plain text format:\n`[TIMESTAMP] [ERROR_CODE] [MESSAGE] [REQUEST_ID] -- Exception: [TYPE]: [MESSAGE] -- Traceback: [...]`\n\n## 4. Trigger/Action System\n\nThe trigger/action system provides a mechanism for automating responses to specific errors.\n\n-   **Triggers** are defined by the type of exception (e.g., `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`).\n-   **Actions** are the operations to perform when a trigger matches (e.g., `log_critical`, `webhook`).\n\n### 4.1. Example Configuration (`error_handler_config.yaml`)\n\n```yaml\nverbosity: production\ntriggers:\n  - exception_type: requests.exceptions.ConnectionError\n    actions:\n      - type: log_critical\n        message: \"External provider connection failed.\"\n      - type: webhook\n        url: \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/...\"\n        payload:\n          text: \"CRITICAL: Provider connection error detected in Zotify API.\"\n```\n\n## 5. Integration Strategy\n\n1.  The `ErrorHandler` singleton will be instantiated in `api/src/zotify_api/main.py`.\n2.  The configuration will be loaded from `error_handler_config.yaml`.\n3.  `register_fastapi_hooks()` will be called to attach the middleware to the FastAPI app.\n4.  `register_system_hooks()` will be called to set the global `sys.excepthook` and asyncio loop handler.\n\nThis ensures that any unhandled exception, regardless of its origin, will be funneled through the central `ErrorHandler` for consistent processing.\n",

    "last_updated": "N/A",
    "content": "# Installation Guide\n\nThis document provides detailed instructions for installing and setting up the Zotify API.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:\n\n-   **Python 3.10 or greater**\n-   **pip**: The Python package installer.\n-   **Git**: For cloning the repository.\n\n## Installation\n\nThis installation guide is for developers and operators who want to run the API from the source code.\n\n### 1. Clone the Repository\n\nFirst, clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Patrick010/zotify-API.git\ncd zotify-API\n```\n\n### 2. Install Dependencies\n\nThe API's dependencies are listed in `api/pyproject.toml`. It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment.\n\n```bash\n# Create and activate a virtual environment\npython3 -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\n\n# Install dependencies from within the project root\npip install -e ./api\n```\n\n### 3. Configure the Environment\n\nThe API requires several environment variables to be set. The recommended way to manage these is with a `.env` file located in the `api/` directory. The application will automatically load this file on startup.\n\n**Example `.env` file for Production:**\n```\nAPP_ENV=\"production\"\nADMIN_API_KEY=\"your_super_secret_admin_key\"\nDATABASE_URI=\"sqlite:///storage/zotify.db\"\n```\n\n### 4. Running the API\n\nThe application is run using `uvicorn`, a high-performance ASGI server.\n\nTo run the server, execute the following command from the `/api` directory:\n```bash\nuvicorn zotify_api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000\n```\n\nFor development, you can enable hot-reloading:\n```bash\nuvicorn zotify_api.main:app --reload\n```\n\n## Running the Test Suite\n\nFollow these steps to run the test suite.\n\n### 1. Create the Storage Directory\n\nThe API requires a `storage` directory for its database and other files during tests. From the root of the project, create it inside the `api` directory:\n```bash\nmkdir api/storage\n```\n\n### 2. Run Pytest\n\nThe test suite requires the `APP_ENV` environment variable to be set to `test`. You must set this variable when you run `pytest`.\n\nFrom inside the `api` directory, run:\n```bash\nAPP_ENV=test python3 -m pytest\n```\nThis will discover and run all tests in the `tests/` directory.\n",

    "last_updated": "N/A",
    "content": "# Gonk Test UI\n\n## Overview\n\nGonk Test UI is a standalone developer tool for testing the Zotify API. It is a lightweight, web-based tool designed to make testing and interacting with the Zotify API as simple as possible. It runs as a completely separate application from the main Zotify API and is intended for development purposes only.\n\n## Features\n\n-   **Dynamic API Endpoint Discovery**: Automatically fetches the OpenAPI schema from a running Zotify API instance and displays a list of all available endpoints.\n-   **Interactive API Forms**: Generates web forms for each endpoint, allowing you to easily provide parameters and request bodies.\n-   **Real-time API Responses**: Displays the full JSON response from the API immediately after a request is made.\n-   **State-Aware Spotify Authentication**: Provides a dynamic button to initiate the Spotify OAuth2 login flow in a popup window. The button's state (Login/Logout) is automatically updated based on the API's true authentication status.\n-   **Integrated Database Browser**: Includes an embedded `sqlite-web` interface, allowing you to browse and query the development database directly from the UI.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThis guide will walk you through the setup and usage of the Gonk Test UI.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n-   Python 3.10+\n-   The main Zotify API application must be running (usually on `http://localhost:8000`).\n\n### 1. Installation\n\nThis tool has its own set of dependencies, which need to be installed separately from the main Zotify API.\n\nFirst, navigate to the `gonk-testUI` directory in your terminal:\n```bash\ncd gonk-testUI\n```\n\nNext, install the required Python packages using its `pyproject.toml` file. The recommended way to do this is with `pip` in editable mode:\n```bash\npip install -e .\n```\nThis command will install the packages listed in `pyproject.toml` (`Flask` and `sqlite-web`) into your Python environment.\n\n### 2. Configuration\n\nThe tool needs to know the location of the Zotify API's database to launch the `sqlite-web` browser. This is configured via an environment variable.\n\nBefore running the tool, set the `DATABASE_URI` environment variable to point to the Zotify API's database file.\n\n**For Linux/macOS:**\n```bash\nexport DATABASE_URI=\"sqlite:///../api/storage/zotify.db\"\n```\n\n**For Windows (Command Prompt):**\n```bash\nset DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///../api/storage/zotify.db\n```\n*Note: The path is relative to the `gonk-testUI` directory.*\n\n### 3. Running the Application\n\nOnce the dependencies are installed and the environment variable is set, you can run the application.\n\nThe server can be started with a configurable IP, port, and Zotify API URL:\n```bash\n# Run with all defaults\n# Server on 0.0.0.0:8082, connects to API at http://localhost:8000\npython app.py\n\n# Run on a specific IP and port\npython app.py --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 8083\n\n# Point to a specific Zotify API instance\npython app.py --api-url http://192.168.1.100:8000\n```\n*(Make sure you are still inside the `gonk-testUI` directory when running this command.)*\n\n**Command-Line Arguments:**\n-   `--ip`: The IP address to bind the UI server to. Defaults to `0.0.0.0`.\n-   `--port`: The port to run the UI server on. Defaults to `8082`.\n-   `--api-url`: The base URL of the Zotify API instance you want to test. Defaults to `http://localhost:8000`.\n\nYou can then access the Gonk Test UI in your web browser at the address the server is running on (e.g., `http://localhost:8082`).\n\n### 4. How to Use the UI\n\nFor detailed instructions on how to use the features of the UI, please refer to the [User Manual](./docs/USER_MANUAL.md).\n",

    "content": "# Gonk Test UI - Architecture\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `gonk-testUI` is a standalone web application built with Flask. It is designed to be completely independent of the main Zotify API application, acting only as an external client.\n\n## Components\n\n### 1. Flask Backend (`app.py`)\n\n-   **Web Server**: A simple Flask application serves as the backend for the UI.\n-   **Static File Serving**: It serves the main `index.html` page and its associated static assets (`app.js`, `styles.css`).\n-   **Process Management**: It contains two API endpoints (`/launch-sqlite-web` and `/stop-sqlite-web`) that are responsible for launching and terminating the `sqlite-web` server as a background subprocess. This allows the UI to control the lifecycle of the database browser.\n\n### 2. Frontend (`static/`)\n\n-   **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that provides the structure for the user interface.\n-   **`styles.css`**: Provides basic styling to make the UI usable.\n-   **`app.js`**: The core of the frontend logic.\n    -   It is a single-page application that dynamically renders content.\n    -   On load, it fetches the OpenAPI schema (`/openapi.json`) from the Zotify API. This makes the UI automatically adapt to any changes in the API's endpoints.\n    -   It uses the schema to build interactive forms for each endpoint.\n    -   It uses the `fetch` API to send requests to the Zotify API and displays the JSON response.\n    -   It interacts with the `gonk-testUI` backend to manage the `sqlite-web` process.\n\n### 3. `sqlite-web` Integration\n\n-   `sqlite-web` is a third-party tool that is installed as a dependency.\n-   It is launched as a completely separate process by the Flask backend.\n-   The main UI embeds the `sqlite-web` interface using an `<iframe>`. This provides a seamless user experience, but the two applications remain decoupled.\n",

    "content": "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, ahe GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\n  and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n",

    "content": "# Gonk Test UI - User Manual\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThis section will guide you through the setup and launch of the Gonk Test UI application.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n-   You must have Python 3.10 or higher installed on your system.\n-   The main Zotify API application must be running, as the Gonk Test UI interacts with it. By default, the Zotify API runs on `http://localhost:8000`.\n\n### 1. Installation\n\nThe Gonk Test UI is a standalone application with its own set of dependencies. These must be installed before running the tool.\n\nFirst, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `gonk-testUI` directory, which is located at the root of the project.\n```bash\ncd path/to/project/gonk-testUI\n```\n\nNext, install the required Python packages. The dependencies are listed in the `pyproject.toml` file. You can install them using `pip`:\n```bash\npip install -e .\n```\nThis command installs the necessary packages (`Flask` and `sqlite-web`) and also installs the `gonk-testUI` project in \"editable\" mode, which is good for development.\n\n### 2. Configuration\n\nFor the integrated database browser (`sqlite-web`) to work, the tool needs to know where the Zotify API's database file is located. This is configured by setting an environment variable.\n\nBefore running the application, you must set the `DATABASE_URI` environment variable.\n\n**On Linux or macOS:**\n```bash\nexport DATABASE_URI=\"sqlite:///../api/storage/zotify.db\"\n```\n\n**On Windows (Command Prompt):**\n```bash\nset DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///../api/storage/zotify.db\n```\nThis path points to the default location of the database file relative to the `gonk-testUI` directory. If your database is located elsewhere, you will need to adjust the path accordingly.\n\n### 3. Running the Application\n\nOnce the installation and configuration are complete, you can start the Gonk Test UI server.\n\nFrom within the `gonk-testUI` directory, run the following command:\n```bash\n# Run with all defaults\n# Server on 0.0.0.0:8082, connects to API at http://localhost:8000\npython app.py\n\n# Run on a specific IP and port\npython app.py --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 8083\n\n# Point to a specific Zotify API instance\npython app.py --api-url http://192.168.1.100:8000\n```\n\nYou should see output indicating that the Flask server is running. You can use the following optional flags:\n-   `--ip`: The IP address to bind the UI server to (default: `0.0.0.0`).\n-   `--port`: The port to run the UI server on (default: `8082`).\n-   `--api-url`: The base URL of the Zotify API to test (default: `http://localhost:8000`).\n\n### 4. Accessing the UI\n\nOpen your web browser and navigate to the address the server is running on (e.g., `http://localhost:8082` or `http://127.0.0.1:8083`).\n\nYou should now see the Gonk Test UI interface.\n\n---\n\n## Using the UI\n\n### Main Interface\n\nThe UI is divided into two main sections:\n-   **API Section (Left)**: For interacting with the Zotify API endpoints.\n-   **Database Section (Right)**: For browsing the development database using `sqlite-web`.\n\n### Using the API Tester\n\n1.  **Loading Endpoints**: When you first load the page, the UI automatically fetches the OpenAPI schema from the running Zotify API. The list of all available API endpoints is then displayed in the \"API Endpoints\" panel on the left.\n\n2.  **Generating an API Form**: Click on any endpoint button in the list. A form will be dynamically generated for that specific endpoint, with fields for all necessary parameters (path, query, request body) and an optional field for the Admin API Key.\n\n3.  **Sending a Request**: Fill out the form with the desired values and click the \"Send Request\" button.\n\n4.  **Viewing the Response**: The JSON response from the API will be displayed in the \"API Response\" panel.\n\n### Using the Database Browser\n\n1.  **Launching sqlite-web**: To browse the database, you must first start the `sqlite-web` server. Click the **\"Launch sqlite-web\"** button at the top of the page. This will start the server in the background on port **8081**.\n\n2.  **Browsing the Database**: After a few seconds, the `sqlite-web` interface will load in the `<iframe>` on the right. You can now browse tables, run queries, and manage data.\n\n3.  **Stopping sqlite-web**: When you are finished, click the **\"Stop sqlite-web\"** button to shut down the database browser server.\n\n### Spotify Authentication and Session Management\n\nThe UI provides a dynamic button in the header to manage the Spotify authentication session.\n\n#### Checking Login Status\nOn page load, the UI automatically checks with the Zotify API to see if you are already authenticated with Spotify. This requires a valid **Admin API Key** to be present in one of the generated forms on the page. If no key is provided, the login button will be disabled.\n\n#### Logging In\n1.  Ensure you have entered your Admin API Key in at least one of the API forms. The login button should now be enabled.\n2.  If the button says **\"Login with Spotify\"**, clicking it will open a small popup window with the Spotify authorization page.\n3.  Log in to your Spotify account in the popup.\n4.  After you approve the permissions, the popup will communicate with the Zotify API backend, save your credentials, and then close automatically.\n5.  The main UI page will detect the successful login, and the button will change to say **\"Logout\"**.\n\n#### Logging Out\n1.  If the button says **\"Logout\"**, clicking it will send a request to the Zotify API to clear your stored Spotify credentials from the database.\n2.  This requires a valid **Admin API Key** to be present in one of the API forms.\n3.  Upon success, the button will change back to **\"Login with Spotify\"**.\n",

This makes the script more resilient and prevents it from crashing.\n\n### Related Documents\n- `gonk-testUI/static/app.js`\n\n---\n\n## ACT-011: Fix `gonk-testUI` Form Layout\n\n**Date:** 2025-08-13\n**Status:** \u2705 Done\n**Assignee:** Jules\n\n### Objective\nTo improve the user experience of the `gonk-testUI` by placing the API endpoint forms in a more intuitive location.\n\n### Outcome\n- The JavaScript logic in `gonk-testUI/static/app.js` was modified to insert the generated form directly below the endpoint button that was clicked, rather than in a fixed container at the bottom of the page.\n- The redundant form container was removed from `gonk-testUI/templates/index.html`.\n\n### Related Documents\n- `gonk-testUI/static/app.js`\n- `gonk-testUI/templates/index.html`\n\n---\n\n## ACT-010: Add Theme Toggle to `gonk-testUI`\n\n**Date:** 2025-08-13\n**Status:** \u2705 Done\n**Assignee:** Jules\n\n### Objective\nTo add a dark/light mode theme toggle to the `gonk-testUI` to improve usability.\n\n### Outcome\n- Refactored `gonk-testUI/static/styles.css` to use CSS variables for theming.\n- Added a theme toggle button with custom SVG icons to `gonk-testUI/templates/index.html`.\n- Implemented the theme switching logic in `gonk-testUI/static/app.js`, with the user's preference saved to `localStorage` for persistence.\n\n### Related Documents\n- `gonk-testUI/static/styles.css`\n- `gonk-testUI/templates/index.html`\n- `gonk-testUI/static/app.js`\n\n---\n\n## ACT-009: Make `gonk-testUI` Server Configurable\n\n**Date:** 2025-08-13\n**Status:** \u2705 Done\n**Assignee:** Jules\n\n### Objective\nTo allow the `gonk-testUI` server's IP, port, and target API URL to be configured via the command line.\n\n### Outcome\n- Modified `gonk-testUI/app.py` to use `argparse` to accept `--ip`, `--port`, and `--api-url` arguments.\n- Updated the backend to pass the configured API URL to the frontend by rendering `index.html` as a template.\n- Updated the `README.md` and `USER_MANUAL.md` to document the new command-line flags.\n\n### Related Documents\n- `gonk-testUI/app.py`\n- `gonk-testUI/templates/index.html`\n- `gonk-testUI/static/app.js`\n- `gonk-testUI/README.md`\n\n---\n\n## ACT-008: Fix API Startup Crash and Add CORS Policy\n\n**Date:** 2025-08-13\n**Status:** \u2705 Done\n**Assignee:** Jules\n\n### Objective\nTo fix a `503 Service Unavailable` error that prevented the API from starting correctly and to properly document the required CORS policy.\n\n### Outcome\n- Fixed a `NameError` in `api/src/zotify_api/routes/auth.py` that caused the API to crash.\n- Added FastAPI's `CORSMiddleware` to `main.py` to allow cross-origin requests from the test UI.\n- Improved the developer experience by setting a default `ADMIN_API_KEY` in development mode.\n- Documented the CORS policy across all relevant project documents (HLD, LLD, Operator Guide, Traceability Matrix) and logged the work in the

    "content": "# Future Enhancements & Product Vision\n\n> **Note:** See the [`TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`](./TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md) for status and implementation tracking of these enhancements.\n\n**Date:** 2025-08-11\n**Status:** Living Document\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis document serves as a dedicated \"parking lot\" for new ambitions and feature ideas that have emerged during development but are not part of the current, committed roadmap. It is meant to capture long-term vision without disrupting the alignment and verification process of the active development phases.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Planned Technical Enhancements\n\nThis section lists specific technical features and improvements that are candidates for future development phases.\n\n*   **Advanced Admin Endpoint Security:**\n    *   Transition from a static admin API key to a more robust, layered security model, including rate limiting, JWT/OAuth2 for user-level endpoints, and dynamic key rotation.\n*   **Persistent & Distributed Job Queue:**\n    *   Replace the current in-memory download queue with a persistent, database or Redis-backed system to ensure job durability across restarts and to support distributed workers.\n*   **Full Spotify OAuth2 Integration & Library Sync:**\n    *   Expand the Spotify integration to include full, two-way synchronization (write-sync) for playlists.\n    *   Implement full library management, including the ability to read and modify a user's saved albums and liked tracks.\n*   **Enhanced Download & Job Management:**\n    *   Implement detailed, real-time progress reporting for download jobs.\n    *   Introduce user notifications for job completion or failure.\n    *   Develop sophisticated retry policies with exponential backoff and error classification.\n*   **API Governance:**\n    *   Implement API rate limiting and usage quotas per user or API key to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse.\n*   **Observability:**\n    *   Improve the audit trail with more detailed event logging.\n    *   Add real-time monitoring hooks for integration with external monitoring systems.\n*   **Standardized Error Handling & Logging:**\n    *   Implement a standardized error schema for all API responses.\n    *   Refactor the service layer to raise domain-specific exceptions instead of `HTTPException`s.\n    *   Establish a consistent logging format and convention across all services.\n*   **Comprehensive Health Checks:**\n    *   Expand the system info endpoints to include detailed process stats, disk/network health, and dependency checks.\n*   **Unified Configuration Management:**\n    *   Unify the two configuration systems (`config.py` and `config_service.py`). This would likely involve migrating the settings from `config.json` into the main database and providing a single, consistent API for managing all application settings at runtime.\n*   **Snitch Module Enhancement:**\n    *   Investigate the further development of the conceptual `Snitch` module.\n    *   Potential enhancements include running it as a persistent background service, developing it into a browser plugin for seamless integration, or expanding it to handle multi-service authentication flows.\n\n---\n\n## 3. API Adoption & Usability Philosophy\n\nBeyond technical features, the long-term success of the API depends on making it irresistibly easy and valuable for developers to adopt. The following principles will guide future development.\n\n### 3.1. Crazy Simple Usage\n*   **Goal:** Minimize setup and authentication friction. Ensure the API works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults.\n*   **Actions:**\n    *   Provide ready-made SDKs or client libraries for popular languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Go).\n    *   Develop a collection of example apps, recipes, and templates for common use cases.\n    *   Maintain a clear, concise, and consistent API design and error handling schema.\n\n### 3.2. Feature-Rich Beyond Spotify API\n*   **Goal:** Provide capabilities that the standard Spotify API lacks, making our API more powerful for specific use cases.\n*   **Actions:**\n    *   Build out advanced download management features (progress, retry, queue control).\n    *   Support bulk operations for efficient management of tracks and playlists.\n    *   Integrate caching and local state synchronization to improve performance and resilience.\n\n### 3.3. Competitive Differentiators\n*   **Goal:** Focus on features that make our API stand out in terms of reliability, security, and performance.\n*   **Actions:**\n    *   **Transparency:** Provide clear audit logs and job state visibility.\n    *   **Security:** Start with strong security defaults and provide a clear roadmap to advanced, layered authentication.\n    *   **Performance:** Offer background processing for long-running tasks and intelligent rate limits.\n    *   **Extensibility:** Design for extensibility with features like webhooks and a plugin system.\n\n### 3.4. Pragmatic Documentation & Support\n*   **Goal:** Create documentation that is practical, example-driven, and helps developers solve real-world problems quickly.\n*   **Actions:**\n    *   Focus on \"how-to\" guides and tutorials over purely theoretical references.\n    *   Establish a developer community channel (e.g., Discord, forum) for feedback, support, and collaboration.\n\n---\n\n# Future Enhancements: Framework & Multi-Service Accessibility\n\n## Web UI\n- Clean, responsive HTML/CSS/JS templates that let users browse, search, queue downloads, manage playlists, view statuses\u2014all without writing code.\n\n## Query Language\n- A beginner-friendly, expressive query syntax or DSL for filtering and manipulating tracks/playlists. Not just simple filters but advanced ops like:\n  - Create, edit, delete playlists\n  - Merge playlists with rules (e.g., remove duplicates, reorder by popularity)\n  - Import/export playlists in multiple formats (Spotify, M3U, JSON, CSV)\n  - Search by genre, artist, album, release year, popularity, explicit content flags\n  - Bulk actions (tag editing, batch downloads)\n  - Smart dynamic playlists (auto-update by criteria)\n- Investigate and prototype integration of AI-driven natural language processing (NLP) to allow users to express queries and commands in everyday language.\n  - Enable transforming human-readable requests into precise API queries or playlist manipulations without requiring formal syntax knowledge.\n  - Examples:\n    - \"Create a playlist of upbeat rock songs from the 90s.\"\n    - \"Merge my jazz and blues playlists but remove duplicates.\"\n    - \"Show me tracks by artists similar to Radiohead released after 2010.\"\n  - This would drastically lower the entry barrier and make advanced functionality accessible to casual users.\n  - Research options include embedding pre-trained language models, or interfacing with cloud NLP APIs, with focus on privacy and performance.\n\n## Scripting / Automation Hooks\n- A lightweight embedded scripting layer or API clients with abstractions for complex workflows (e.g., periodic sync, trigger downloads on new releases).\n\n## Metadata Editing & Enrichment\n- Allow users to edit track metadata locally (tags, cover art), and pull enriched data from third-party sources (e.g., lyrics, credits).\n\n## User Profiles & Sharing\n- Basic multi-user support with saved settings, playlist sharing, favorites, and history.\n\n## Notifications & Progress UI\n- Push notifications or UI alerts for download completions, failures, quota warnings, etc.\n\n## Mobile-friendly Design\n- So users can manage and interact on phones or tablets smoothly.\n\n## Comprehensive Documentation & Examples\n- Usage guides, recipes, and code samples for all common tasks to flatten the learning curve.\n\n---\n\nIf we deliver this whole ecosystem tightly integrated with the API, it won\u2019t just be \u201canother Spotify API clone\u201d but a full-fledged platform that\u2019s accessible to casual users and power users alike\u2014and that\u2019s how you drive adoption and stand out in a crowded market.\n\n---\n\n## Unified Database Layer Adoption\n\nThe recent architectural refactor introducing a backend-agnostic database layer using SQLAlchemy lays the groundwork for more scalable, maintainable data management across all services. While currently focused on core entities (downloads, playlists, tokens), future enhancements should:\n\n- Expand this unified layer to support multi-service integrations and provider-specific data.\n- Implement advanced querying, caching, and transactional features.\n- Ensure smooth migration paths for any additional persistence needs.\n- Maintain strict separation between API logic and data storage for flexibility in swapping backend databases if needed.\n\n**Note:** This foundation is critical and should be a key consideration in any upcoming feature developments, especially multi-provider support and API expansion, but the core refactor is complete and in use. New features must build on top of this layer rather than circumvent it.\n\n\n## Unified Provider Abstraction Layer\n\nTo enable multi-provider support for music services without creating endpoint bloat, a unified abstraction layer will be developed. This layer will translate standardized API requests into provider-specific API calls through connectors.\n\n**Key objectives:**\n- Define a core, normalized set of API endpoints and data models that cover common operations across providers.\n- Implement lightweight translation matrices or connector modules to handle provider-specific API differences.\n- Support pluggable authentication and token management per provider.\n- Avoid duplicating full API gateway solutions like WSO2 by embedding the translation logic within the application layer.\n- Ensure extensibility for easy addition of new music service providers.\n\nThis is a medium- to long-term goal and must be factored into future architectural decisions and design plans.\n\n---\n\n### Provider-Agnostic Feature Specification Extension\n\n**Objective:** Extend the Unified Provider Abstraction Layer by establishing a structured, detailed, and discoverable feature specification process. This ensures all provider-agnostic and provider-specific features are fully documented and tracked.\n\n**Reference:** [Provider-Agnostic Extensions Feature Specification](docs/reference/features/provider_agnostic_extensions.md)\n\n**Key Actions:**\n- Maintain a **metadata integration matrix** for all supported providers, tracking feature coverage, compatibility, and limitations.\n- Define a **Provider Adapter Interface** template to standardize connector modules and simplify integration of new services.\n- Enforce pre-merge checks to ensure new provider-specific or provider-agnostic features have completed spec entries.\n- Retroactively document existing provider integrations in the same structured format.\n- Cross-link specs to `ENDPOINTS.md`, `SYSTEM_SPECIFICATIONS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`.\n\n**Outcome:** Every provider-agnostic or provider-specific feature is discoverable, understandable, and traceable. Developers, maintainers, and auditors can confidently extend or troubleshoot functionality without reverse-engineering code.\n\n**Status:** Proposed \u2013 tracked under `docs/reference/features/provider_agnostic_extensions.md`.\n",

    "content": "# High-Level Design (HLD) \u2013 Zotify API Refactor\n\n**Status:** Live Document\n\n## 1. Purpose\nThis document outlines the high-level architecture, scope, and guiding principles for the ongoing Zotify API refactor. It serves as a blueprint for the development team to maintain alignment with long-term goals.\n\n## 2. Scope\nThe refactor aims to:\n- Transition all subsystems to a **dedicated service layer** architecture.\n- Improve **testability**, **maintainability**, and **separation of concerns**.\n- Establish a **living documentation** workflow where all documentation is kept in constant alignment with the codebase.\n\n## 3. Architecture Overview\n**Key Layers:**\n1. **Routes Layer** \u2014 FastAPI route handlers; minimal logic.\n2. **Service Layer** \u2014 Pure business logic; no framework dependencies.\n3. **Schema Layer** \u2014 Pydantic models for validation and serialization.\n4. **Persistence Layer** \u2014 A unified, backend-agnostic database system built on SQLAlchemy.\n5. **Provider Abstraction Layer** \u2014 An interface that decouples the core application from specific music service providers (e.g., Spotify). All interactions with external music services go through this layer.\n6. **Config Layer** \u2014 Centralized settings with environment-based overrides.\n7. **Generic Error Handling Layer** \u2014 A centralized, platform-wide module for catching, processing, and responding to all exceptions.\n8. **Logging Layer** \u2014 A centralized, extendable service for handling all application logging, including system, audit, and job status logs.\n\n**Data Flow Example (Search Request):**\n1. Request hits FastAPI route.\n2. Route validates input with schema.\n3. Route calls service method (DI injected).\n4. Service queries database or external API.\n5. Response returned using schema.\n\n### 3.1 Supporting Modules\n\nThe Zotify Platform includes supporting modules that are not part of the Core API but are essential to the platform's ecosystem.\n\n-   **Gonk-TestUI:** A standalone developer testing UI built with Flask and JavaScript. It provides a web-based interface for interacting with all API endpoints and includes an embedded database browser. Its architecture is a simple client-server model, where the frontend fetches the API schema dynamically to generate forms. It is designed to be run locally during development.\n\n-   **Snitch:** A helper application for managing the OAuth callback flow for CLI-based clients. Its security model is built on Zero Trust principles, using end-to-end encryption to protect the authorization code as it is passed from the client machine to the remote API server.\n\n### 3.2 Generic Error Handling\n\nTo ensure platform-wide stability and consistent behavior, the system implements a centralized error handling module. This layer is designed to be the single point of processing for all unhandled exceptions, whether they originate from API endpoints, background tasks, or internal service calls.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n-   **Global Interception:** The module hooks into FastAPI's middleware, `sys.excepthook`, and the `asyncio` event loop to provide global coverage.\n-   **Standardized Responses:** It formats all errors into a consistent, predictable schema (e.g., JSON for the API), preventing inconsistent or leaky error messages.\n-   **Configurable Automation:** It features a trigger/action system that can be configured to perform automated actions (e.g., send alerts, retry operations) in response to specific, predefined error types.\n\nThis architectural component is critical for system resilience, maintainability, and providing a clean, professional experience for API consumers.\n\n### 3.3 Logging Layer\n\nTo ensure consistent and comprehensive observability, the platform implements a centralized and extendable logging system. This layer is designed to be the single point of entry for all logging activities across the application.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n- **Centralized Service:** A single `LoggingService` is responsible for receiving and dispatching all log messages.\n- **Pluggable Handlers:** The service uses a handler-based architecture, allowing new logging backends (e.g., console, file, database, external service) to be added without changing core application code.\n- **Multiple Log Types:** The system is designed to handle different types of logs, including standard system/debug messages, structured JSON audit logs for compliance, and database-backed logs for tracking asynchronous jobs.\n\nThis component is critical for debugging, monitoring, and auditing the platform. For a more detailed breakdown, see the [`LOGGING_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`](./LOGGING_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md) document.\n\n## 4. Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Test Coverage**: >90% unit test coverage.\n- **Performance**: <200ms average API response time for common queries.\n- **Security**: Authentication for admin endpoints; input validation on all routes.\n- **Extensibility**: Minimal coupling; future modules plug into the service layer.\n\n## 5. Documentation Governance\n\nThe project is currently in a phase of audit and alignment, where the primary goal is to bring all documentation in sync with the implemented reality of the codebase. The following principles guide this \"living documentation\" approach:\n\n- **Reality First**: The codebase is treated as the ground truth. Documentation is updated to reflect the actual, verified behavior of the application.\n- **Continuous Alignment**: All significant changes to code must be accompanied by corresponding updates to all relevant documentation (e.g., LLD, changelogs, user guides) in the same commit.\n- **Centralized Logging**: All work must be logged in the project's official logs (e.g., `AUDIT-PHASE-3.md`, `ACTIVITY.md`) to maintain a clear, traceable history of changes.\n- **Mandatory Verification**: When new documents are created, a verification step must confirm they are correctly integrated into the existing documentation hierarchy (e.g., linked in `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`).\n\nOnce the codebase and documentation have been fully aligned and the design has stabilized, the project may adopt a more formal \"docs-first\" workflow for future feature development, where design documents are created and approved before implementation begins.\n\n## 6. Deployment Model\n- **Dev**: Local Docker + SQLite\n- **Prod**: Containerized FastAPI app with Postgres and optional Redis\n- CI/CD: GitHub Actions with linting, tests, and build pipelines.\n\n## 7. Security Model\n- OAuth2 for Spotify integration.\n- JWT for API authentication (future step).\n- Principle of least privilege for DB access.\n- **CORS Policy:** The API implements a permissive CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy to allow web-based UIs (like the `gonk-testUI`) from any origin to interact with the API. This is a requirement for browser-based tools.\n\n> Note: Specific, long-term security ambitions are tracked in the [`FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`](./FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md) document.\n\n## 8. Risks & Mitigations\n- **Risk**: Drift between docs and code.\n  **Mitigation**: PR checklist and CI step that flags doc inconsistencies.\n- **Risk**: Large refactor introduces regressions.\n  **Mitigation**: Incremental step-by-step plan with green tests at each stage.\n\n## 9. Security\n\nA comprehensive overview of the security architecture, principles, and roadmap for the Zotify API project is available in the [Zotify API Security](./SECURITY.md) document. This document serves as the definitive security reference for the project.\n\n\n---\n\n## 10. Future Vision\n\nWhile this document outlines the current architecture, the project maintains a separate [`FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`](./FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md) document. This file captures the long-term product vision, including goals for usability, competitive differentiation, and advanced feature sets that go beyond the current roadmap.\n",

This layer is designed to be the single point of processing for all unhandled exceptions, whether they originate from API endpoints, background tasks, or internal service calls.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n-   **Global Interception:** The module hooks into FastAPI's middleware, `sys.excepthook`, and the `asyncio` event loop to provide global coverage.\n-   **Standardized Responses:** It formats all errors into a consistent, predictable schema (e.g., JSON for the API), preventing inconsistent or leaky error messages.\n-   **Configurable Automation:** It features a trigger/action system that can be configured to perform automated actions (e.g., send alerts, retry operations) in response to specific, predefined error types.\n\nThis architectural component is critical for system resilience, maintainability, and providing a clean, professional experience for API consumers.\n\n## 4. Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Test Coverage**: >90% unit test coverage.\n- **Performance**: <200ms average API response time for common queries.\n- **Security**: Authentication for admin endpoints; input validation on all routes.\n- **Extensibility**: Minimal coupling; future modules plug into the service layer.\n\n## 5. Documentation Governance\n\nThe project is currently in a phase of audit and alignment, where the primary goal is to bring all documentation in sync with the implemented reality of the codebase. The following principles guide this \"living documentation\" approach:\n\n- **Reality First**: The codebase is treated as the ground truth. Documentation is updated to reflect the actual, verified behavior of the application.\n- **Continuous Alignment**: All significant changes to code must be accompanied by corresponding updates to all relevant documentation (e.g., LLD, changelogs, user guides) in the same commit.\n- **Centralized Logging**: All work must be logged in the project's official logs (e.g., `AUDIT-PHASE-3.md`, `ACTIVITY.md`) to maintain a clear, traceable history of changes.\n- **Mandatory Verification**: When new documents are created, a verification step must confirm they are correctly integrated into the existing documentation hierarchy (e.g., linked in `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`).\n\nOnce the codebase and documentation have been fully aligned and the design has stabilized, the project may adopt a more formal \"docs-first\" workflow for future feature development, where design documents are created and approved before implementation begins.\n\n## 6. Deployment Model\n- **Dev**: Local Docker + SQLite\n- **Prod**: Containerized FastAPI app with Postgres and optional Redis\n- CI/CD: GitHub Actions with linting, tests, and build pipelines.\n\n## 7. Security Model\n- OAuth2 for Spotify integration.\n- JWT for API authentication (future step).\n- Principle of least privilege for DB access.\n- **CORS Policy:** The API implements a permissive CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy to allow web-based UIs (like the `gonk-testUI`) from any origin to interact with the API. This is a requirement for browser-based tools.\n\n> Note: Specific, long-term security ambitions are tracked in the [`FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`](./FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md) document.\n\n## 8. Risks & Mitigations\n- **Risk**: Drift between docs and code.\n  **Mitigation**: PR checklist and CI step that flags doc inconsistencies.\n- **Risk**: Large refactor introduces regressions.\n  **Mitigation**: Incremental step-by-step plan with green tests at each stage.\n\n## 9. Security\n\nA comprehensive overview of the security architecture, principles, and roadmap for the Zotify API project is available in the [Zotify API Security](./SECURITY.md) document. This document serves as the definitive security reference for the project.\n\n\n---\n\n## 10. Future Vision\n\nWhile this document outlines the current architecture, the project maintains a separate [`FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`](./FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md) document. This file captures the long-term product vision, including goals for usability, competitive differentiation, and advanced feature sets that go beyond the current roadmap.\n",

    "content": "# Logging System Design\n\n**Status:** Proposed\n**Date:** 2025-08-14\n\n## 1. Purpose\nThis document outlines the architecture for a new, extendable logging system for the Zotify API. The goal is to create a robust, centralized service that can handle multiple logging scenarios (e.g., system debug, audit, job progress) in a pluggable and maintainable way.\n\n## 2. Core Architecture: Pluggable Handlers\n\nThe system will be built around a central `LoggingService`. This service will not perform any logging itself; instead, it will act as a dispatcher, forwarding log messages to one or more registered \"handlers.\"\n\n- **`LoggingService`:** A singleton service responsible for receiving all log messages from the application. It will maintain a registry of active handlers.\n- **`BaseLogHandler`:** An abstract base class defining the interface for all handlers (e.g., `handle_message(log_record)`).\n- **Concrete Handlers:** Specific implementations of `BaseLogHandler` for different logging scenarios.\n\nThis design allows new logging capabilities (e.g., sending logs to a new destination, using a new format) to be added simply by creating a new handler class and registering it with the service, without modifying the core application logic.\n\n## 3. Initial Handlers\n\nThe system will be launched with three initial handlers to cover the required log types. The `FileStreamHandler` mentioned in the original document has been redefined as a standard `ConsoleHandler` for simplicity and immediate feedback during development.\n\n### 3.1. System/Debug Handler (`ConsoleHandler`)\n- **Purpose:** For standard application logging during development and operation.\n- **Log Levels Handled:** `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`.\n- **Format:** Simple, human-readable text format.\n- **Example:** `[2025-08-15 17:00:00] [INFO] User 'xyz' successfully authenticated.`\n- **Output:** Standard output (console).\n\n### 3.2. Structured JSON Audit Handler (`JsonAuditHandler`)\n- **Purpose:** For compliance-ready, machine-readable audit trails of security-sensitive and business-critical events.\n- **Log Levels Handled:** `AUDIT`.\n- **Format:** Structured JSON, written to a dedicated, append-only log file (e.g., `logs/audit.json.log`).\n- **Mandatory Fields:**\n  - `timestamp`: ISO 8601 format string.\n  - `event_id`: A unique identifier for the log entry (e.g., UUID).\n  - `event_name`: The name of the audit event (e.g., `user.login.success`, `playlist.create`).\n  - `user_id`: The user associated with the event.\n  - `source_ip`: The source IP address of the request.\n  - `details`: A JSON object containing event-specific data.\n\n### 3.3. Database-backed Job Handler (`DatabaseJobHandler`)\n- **Purpose:** To track the progress and outcomes of long-running, asynchronous jobs (e.g., playlist syncs, downloads).\n- **Log Levels Handled:** `JOB_STATUS`.\n- **Output:** Writes structured data to a dedicated `job_logs` table in the application's primary database.\n- **Database Schema (`job_logs` table):**\n  - `job_id` (string, primary key)\n  - `job_type` (string)\n  - `status` (string: `QUEUED`, `RUNNING`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`)\n  - `progress` (integer, 0-100)\n  - `details` (text/json)\n  - `created_at` (datetime)\n  - `updated_at` (datetime)\n\n## 4. Pluggable Handler Interface\n\nTo allow for extensibility, all handlers must adhere to a common interface, likely defined in a `BaseLogHandler` abstract class.\n\n- **`can_handle(level)`:** A method that returns `True` if the handler is configured to process logs of the given level/type (e.g., a `ConsoleHandler` might handle `DEBUG` through `CRITICAL`, while an `AuditHandler` only handles `AUDIT`).\n- **`emit(log_record)`:** The core method that performs the logging action (e.g., writing to the console, a file, or a database).\n- **`format(log_record)`:** A method that formats the log record into the desired string or structure.\n\n## 5. Integration Points for Zotify API\n- **Instantiation:** The `LoggingService` will be instantiated once in `api/src/zotify_api/main.py`.\n- **Dependency Injection:** The service instance will be made available to all route handlers and services using FastAPI's dependency injection system.\n- **Configuration:** The logging configuration will be loaded from a new file, e.g., `logging_config.yml`, which will be read at startup. This file will define which handlers are active and their specific settings.\n\n## 6. Guidelines for Adding New Handlers\n1. **Create a new handler class** in a file under `api/src/zotify_api/core/logging_handlers/`.\n2. **Inherit from `BaseLogHandler`** and implement the `can_handle` and `emit` methods.\n3. **Define a custom formatter** if required.\n4. **Register the new handler** in the `logging_config.yml` file, specifying its type, log levels, and any other configuration.\n5. The `LoggingService` will automatically discover and initialize the new handler on the next application startup.\n",

    "content": "# Low-Level Design (LLD) \u2013 Zotify API\n\n## Purpose\nThis LLD describes the specific implementation details of the Zotify API's subsystems, with a focus on the new provider-agnostic architecture.\n\n---\n\n## API Middleware\n\nThe FastAPI application uses several middleware to provide cross-cutting concerns.\n\n*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**:\n    *   **Module:** `api/src/zotify_api/main.py`\n    *   **Purpose:** To allow web-based clients (like `gonk-testUI`) hosted on different origins (IP/port) to communicate with the API. This is a browser security requirement.\n    *   **Configuration:** The middleware is configured to be permissive, allowing all origins, methods, and headers (`*`).

    "content": "# Project Initiation Document (PID)\n\n**Project Name:** Zotify API Refactoring and Enhancement  \n**Date:** 2025-08-12  \n**Version:** 1.0\n**Status:** Live Document\n\n---\n\n## 1. Full Business Case\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe Zotify API was originally built as a lightweight wrapper for a single use case\u2014interacting with Spotify through Zotify/Librespot\u2014but without a sustainable architecture for long-term growth. It lacked persistent storage, modularity, and the flexibility to support multiple providers. This project aims to refactor and expand the API to form a robust, scalable, and provider-agnostic backend for automation, integrations, and developer tooling.\n\n**Strategic Goals:**  \n- Transition Zotify from a Spotify-only CLI wrapper into a fully modular API framework capable of integrating with multiple audio content sources.  \n- Lay the foundation for a future-ready architecture that supports automation, sync, analytics, and secure multi-user workflows.  \n- Deliver an API that is developer-friendly, self-documented, and scalable without major redesigns.  \n- Enable both CLI and WebUI-based interactions, giving users and developers a choice of interfaces.  \n\n**Business Benefits:**  \n- **Reduced Operational Risk:** Persistent database eliminates data loss for queues, tokens, and state.  \n- **Faster Development:** Cleaner, modular architecture accelerates new feature delivery.  \n- **Better Scalability:** Prepared for higher load, more data, and multiple integrations.  \n- **Future Expansion:** Provider-agnostic design allows easy addition of new streaming platforms.  \n- **Enhanced Feature Set:** Full two-way playlist sync and advanced automation unlock entirely new workflows.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Detailed Project Scope & Product Breakdown\n\n### 2.1 In Scope\n- Full audit of the codebase against documentation. *(In Progress)*  \n- Refactoring to a unified, SQLAlchemy-based persistence layer.  \n- Migration of all file-based and in-memory data (playlists, tokens, download jobs) to the new database.  \n- Creation of a standalone developer testing UI (`gonk-testUI`) with `sqlite-web` integration.  \n- Complete overhaul of system documentation (`INSTALLATION.md`, `USER_MANUAL.md`, etc.). *(In Progress)*  \n- Creation of formal project management documents (Project Brief, PID).  \n- Initial design and implementation of a provider-agnostic abstraction layer. *(In Progress)*  \n- **Full two-way sync for Spotify playlists** as a core API feature.  \n\n### 2.2 Out of Scope (Current Phase)\n- None of the features are permanently out of scope. However, some items (e.g., **full JWT-based authentication** and other advanced security layers) are **strategic goals** for later phases, after the core architecture and sync features are complete.  \n\n### 2.3 Main Products (Deliverables)\n1. **Refactored Zotify API (v1.0):** New database architecture with modular design.  \n2. **`gonk-testUI` Module (v0.1.0):** Developer testing tool with SQLite inspection.  \n3. **System Documentation Set:** Fully updated `docs/system/` directory.  \n4. **PRINCE2 Project Documentation:** PID, Project Brief, and supporting docs.  \n5. **`scripts/start.sh`:** Unified startup script.  \n6. **Spotify Two-Way Sync Module:** Bidirectional playlist sync, with conflict resolution.  \n\n### 2.4 Deferred Features\nDeferred features are tracked in `project/FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md` until they are promoted to an active roadmap phase. These items are intentionally absent from design docs until scheduled for implementation.\n\nExample of a deferred feature:\n- *Webhook/Event System*\n\n### 2.5 Supporting Modules\nThe Zotify Platform consists of the Core API and official supporting modules, currently:\n- Snitch \u2014 Integrated monitoring and intelligence toolset.\n- Gonk-TestUI \u2014 Frontend testing and interaction suite for validation and QA.\n\nSupporting modules are developed, tracked, and governed under the same policies, workflows, and quality standards as the Core API.\n**Note:** Retroactive work on these modules must be documented and incorporated into all relevant project files.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Stage Plans (High-Level)\n\n- **Stage 1: Audit & Alignment** *(In Progress)* \u2014 Code/documentation gap analysis and alignment.  \n- **Stage 2: Core Refactoring** *(Completed)* \u2014 Unified database, new dev UI.  \n- **Stage 3: Documentation & Formalization** *(In Progress)* \u2014 Full system documentation, formal project docs.  \n- **Stage 4: Provider Abstraction** *(In Progress)* \u2014 Design and partial implementation of multi-provider layer.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Project Controls\n\n- **Reporting:** Progress tracked in `project/` (`ACTIVITY.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`).  \n- **Change Control:** All changes require proposal, approval, and re-approval if scope deviates.  \n- **Handling of Postponed Tasks:** Postponed or paused tasks must be moved from the `ACTIVITY.md` log to the `BACKLOG.md` with an appropriate status. This ensures the activity log remains a clear record of completed or actively in-progress work.\n- **Backlog Management and Task Qualification:** To ensure a structured and traceable workflow, the following process is mandatory for managing the `BACKLOG.md`:\n  - **Task Generation:**\n    - Each task added to the backlog must reference at least one source item from a live project document (e.g., `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`, `USECASES.md`, `FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`).\n    - All tasks must conform to the template defined in `BACKLOG.md`, including fields for Task ID, Source, Description, Dependencies, Acceptance Criteria, Effort, and Priority.\n  - **Task Qualification:**\n    - A task is only eligible for execution if all of its dependencies are resolved, its acceptance criteria are fully defined, and its source references are valid.\n    - Priority alone is not sufficient to begin work on a task; it must meet all readiness criteria.\n  - **Review and Audit:**\n    - A review of the backlog will be conducted at the start of each major work cycle to ensure tasks are traceable and meet readiness criteria.\n    - A periodic audit will be performed to remove unlinked or outdated tasks.\n- **Quality Assurance:**  \n  - Code reviews before merge.  \n  - Unit/integration testing (test runner stability is a known issue).  \n  - Continuous documentation updates in sync with code changes.  \n  - **Logging of Changes:** All significant changes (e.g., refactors, new features) must be logged and reflected in all relevant project documentation (PID, HLD, LLD, CHANGELOG, etc.) as part of the implementation task itself. This ensures the 'living documentation' principle is maintained.\n  - **Traceability Matrix Maintenance:** `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` is a live document. All requirement, enhancement, or system-level changes must update the matrix in the same commit.\n  - **Use Case Gap Analysis Maintenance:** Any time a new use case is added to `USECASES.md`, the `USECASES_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` must be updated to reflect its implementation status. The gap analysis will be formally reviewed once per major release cycle to ensure accuracy.\n  - **Verification of Documentation Integration:** When new documents are created, a verification step must be performed to ensure they are correctly integrated and referenced in the existing documentation hierarchy (e.g., `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`).\n  - **Feature Specification Maintenance:** All new or modified functionality (including Core API, Supporting Modules, etc.) must have a corresponding, up-to-date entry in the Feature Specification documents (`api/docs/reference/FEATURE_SPECS.md`). This is a mandatory requirement for pull request approval.\n  - **Structured Logging Mandate:** All new and existing functionality must use the centralized, extendable `LoggingService` for all logging. This includes structured events for auditing, job status, and performance metrics, as outlined in the `LOGGING_GUIDE.md`. Direct use of `print()` statements or basic loggers for application events is forbidden.\n  - **Centralized Error Handling Mandate:** All unhandled exceptions across the entire platform (including API, background tasks, and CLI tools) must be processed by the Generic Error Handling Module. This module provides standardized error responses, structured logging, and a configurable trigger/action system for automated responses. Direct, unhandled exceptions that result in a crash or an inconsistent error format are forbidden. See `ERROR_HANDLING_DESIGN.md` and `ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md` for details.\n  - **Preservation of Previous Versions:** Before modifying any existing project documentation (`.md` files), a copy of the file must be made with the suffix `_previous` (e.g., `PID_previous.md`). This ensures that a record of the last stable version is always available for easy rollback or comparison.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Risk, Issue, and Quality Registers\n\n- **Risk Register:**  \n  - *Risk:* Development tools for filesystem manipulation/testing are unreliable.  \n  - *Impact:* Delays and workarounds reduce efficiency.  \n  - *Mitigation:* External code review, safe file operations instead of rename/move.  \n\n- **Issue Register:**  \n  - *Issue #1:* Duplicate `devtools/` directory exists alongside `gonk-testUI/`.  \n  - *Status:* Open.  \n  - *Impact:* Minor clutter, no functional risk.  \n  - *Action:* Cleanup in future refactor.  \n\n- **Quality Register:**  \n  - All code must be reviewed.  \n  - All docs must be updated with every change.  \n  - PID, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `ACTIVITY.md` remain in sync.  \n\n---\n\n## 6. Project Organisation (Roles & Responsibilities)\n\n- **Project Board / Project Executive:** Primary user \u2014 provides mandate, sets requirements, approves plans.  \n- **Project Manager:** Primary user \u2014 manages flow, gives detailed direction.  \n- **Senior Supplier / Lead Developer:** Jules (AI agent) \u2014 responsible for technical design, implementation, testing, and documentation.  \n\n---\n\n## 7. Communication Management Approach\n\n- All communication via interactive session.  \n- Jules provides regular updates and `CURRENT_STATE.md` hand-offs.  \n- User provides approvals and new directives.  \n\n---\n\n## 8. Configuration Management Approach\n\n- **Source Code:** Managed in Git with feature branches.  \n- **Documentation:** Markdown in repo, versioned alongside code.  \n- **Project State:** Tracked in living docs (`ACTIVITY.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `PID.md`).  \n\n---\n\n## 9. Tailoring Approach\n\n- PRINCE2 principles applied in a minimal, agile form for a one-on-one AI/human workflow.  \n- Quality, risk, and change managed through interactive process and living documentation.  \n- Stage boundaries managed via user approval of new high-level plans.  \n\n---\n\nAppendix / References\n\n    project/ROADMAP.md\n\n    project/EXECUTION_PLAN.md\n\n    project/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md\n\n    project/PROJECT_REGISTRY.md\n\n    docs/providers/spotify.md (starter)\n\n    project/ACTIVITY.md (live)\n\n    project/CURRENT_STATE.md (live)\n",

    "content": "# Project Initiation Document (PID)\n\n**Project Name:** Zotify API Refactoring and Enhancement\n**Date:** 2025-08-12\n**Version:** 1.0\n**Status:** Live Document\n\n---\n\n## 1. Full Business Case\n\n**Justification:**\nThe Zotify API was originally built as a lightweight wrapper for a single use case\u2014interacting with Spotify through Zotify/Librespot\u2014but without a sustainable architecture for long-term growth. It lacked persistent storage, modularity, and the flexibility to support multiple providers. This project aims to refactor and expand the API to form a robust, scalable, and provider-agnostic backend for automation, integrations, and developer tooling.\n\n**Strategic Goals:**\n- Transition Zotify from a Spotify-only CLI wrapper into a fully modular API framework capable of integrating with multiple audio content sources.\n- Lay the foundation for a future-ready architecture that supports automation, sync, analytics, and secure multi-user workflows.\n- Deliver an API that is developer-friendly, self-documented, and scalable without major redesigns.\n- Enable both CLI and WebUI-based interactions, giving users and developers a choice of interfaces.\n\n**Business Benefits:**\n- **Reduced Operational Risk:** Persistent database eliminates data loss for queues, tokens, and state.\n- **Faster Development:** Cleaner, modular architecture accelerates new feature delivery.\n- **Better Scalability:** Prepared for higher load, more data, and multiple integrations.\n- **Future Expansion:** Provider-agnostic design allows easy addition of new streaming platforms.\n- **Enhanced Feature Set:** Full two-way playlist sync and advanced automation unlock entirely new workflows.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Detailed Project Scope & Product Breakdown\n\n### 2.1 In Scope\n- Full audit of the codebase against documentation. *(In Progress)*\n- Refactoring to a unified, SQLAlchemy-based persistence layer.\n- Migration of all file-based and in-memory data (playlists, tokens, download jobs) to the new database.\n- Creation of a standalone developer testing UI (`gonk-testUI`) with `sqlite-web` integration.\n- Complete overhaul of system documentation (`INSTALLATION.md`, `USER_MANUAL.md`, etc.). *(In Progress)*\n- Creation of formal project management documents (Project Brief, PID).\n- Initial design and implementation of a provider-agnostic abstraction layer. *(In Progress)*\n- **Full two-way sync for Spotify playlists** as a core API feature.\n\n### 2.2 Out of Scope (Current Phase)\n- None of the features are permanently out of scope. However, some items (e.g., **full JWT-based authentication** and other advanced security layers) are **strategic goals** for later phases, after the core architecture and sync features are complete.\n\n### 2.3 Main Products (Deliverables)\n1. **Refactored Zotify API (v1.0):** New database architecture with modular design.\n2. **`gonk-testUI` Module (v0.1.0):** Developer testing tool with SQLite inspection.\n3. **System Documentation Set:** Fully updated `docs/system/` directory.\n4. **PRINCE2 Project Documentation:** PID, Project Brief, and supporting docs.\n5. **`scripts/start.sh`:** Unified startup script.\n6. **Spotify Two-Way Sync Module:** Bidirectional playlist sync, with conflict resolution.\n\n### 2.4 Deferred Features\nDeferred features are tracked in `project/FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md` until they are promoted to an active roadmap phase. These items are intentionally absent from design docs until scheduled for implementation.\n\nExample of a deferred feature:\n- *Webhook/Event System*\n\n### 2.5 Supporting Modules\nThe Zotify Platform consists of the Core API and official supporting modules, currently:\n- Snitch \u2014 Integrated monitoring and intelligence toolset.\n- Gonk-TestUI \u2014 Frontend testing and interaction suite for validation and QA.\n\nSupporting modules are developed, tracked, and governed under the same policies, workflows, and quality standards as the Core API.\n**Note:** Retroactive work on these modules must be documented and incorporated into all relevant project files.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Stage Plans (High-Level)\n\n- **Stage 1: Audit & Alignment** *(In Progress)* \u2014 Code/documentation gap analysis and alignment.\n- **Stage 2: Core Refactoring** *(Completed)* \u2014 Unified database, new dev UI.\n- **Stage 3: Documentation & Formalization** *(In Progress)* \u2014 Full system documentation, formal project docs.\n- **Stage 4: Provider Abstraction** *(In Progress)* \u2014 Design and partial implementation of multi-provider layer.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Project Objectives and Justification\n\n**Objective:** To refactor the existing Zotify-based API into **Gonk**, a professional-grade, multi-service media automation platform. This involves making the system robust, scalable, maintainable, and fully documented, with a clear path toward becoming provider-agnostic.\n\n**Justification:** The original API was tightly coupled to Spotify and suffered from several architectural deficiencies:\n- Inconsistent and non-persistent data storage (in-memory queues, JSON files).\n- Lack of clear separation between logic layers.\n- Incomplete and outdated documentation.\n- No abstraction for supporting multiple providers.\n\nThis project addresses these issues through a structured audit and a series of architectural refactors, reducing technical debt and enabling future expansion to multiple music/media services.\n\n## 2. Business Case Summary\n\nPrimary business drivers:\n- **Improved Maintainability:** Clean, well-documented architecture reduces future development and debugging costs.\n- **Reliability & Scalability:** Unified database persistence supports more users and larger datasets.\n- **Future-Proofing:** Provider-agnostic design enables integration with multiple services, expanding reach and features.\n- **Developer Onboarding:** Comprehensive documentation and the `gonk-testUI` tool lower the entry barrier for new contributors.\n\n## 3. Project Scope Outline\n\n**In Scope (Current Phase):**\n- Full audit of the existing codebase against documentation.\n- Refactoring to a unified, SQLAlchemy-based database persistence layer.\n- Creation of a standalone developer testing UI (`gonk-testUI`).\n- Complete overhaul of system and project documentation.\n- Planning and design of a provider-agnostic abstraction layer.\n- Implementation of full two-way sync for Spotify playlists \u2014 **Stage 1: Audit & Alignment** completed, **Phase 3 in progress**, **Stage 3: Documentation & Formalization** in progress, **Stage 4: Provider Abstraction** in progress.\n\n**Out of Scope (for current phase, but planned for future):**\n- Additional music/media providers beyond Spotify.\n- Full implementation of JWT-based authentication or other advanced security layers (strategic vision, to be implemented later).\n\n## 4. High-Level Deliverables\n\n1. **Refactored Gonk API** with a unified persistence layer.\n2. **Standalone Developer Testing UI (`gonk-testUI`)** for API testing and DB browsing.\n3. **Comprehensive Documentation Set** covering installation, usage, development, and operations.\n4. **Living Project Management Documents** (PID, Activity Log, Current State, Roadmap).\n5. **Startup Script** for robust API server launch.\n\n## 5. Initial Risks and Constraints\n\n- **Technical Risk:** Development environment instability (file system issues, flaky test runners) may cause delays or require workarounds.\n- **Constraint:** Must be backend-agnostic for database and provider-agnostic for services.\n- **Constraint:** All work must follow the living documentation policy.\n\n## 6. Key Stakeholders and Roles\n\n- **Project Executive / Senior User:** Primary driver of requirements and vision.\n- **Senior Supplier / Lead Developer:** Jules (AI agent) \u2014 technical implementation.\n- **Project Manager:** The user \u2014 direction, approvals, and management.\n\n## 7. High-Level Timeline / Approach\n\nThis is an iterative, milestone-based project. Phases:\n\n1. **Audit & Alignment** \u2014 Completed.\n2. **Unified Database Refactoring** \u2014 Completed.\n3. **Developer Tooling (`gonk-testUI`)** \u2014 Completed.\n4. **System Documentation Overhaul** \u2014 Completed.\n5. **PRINCE2 Documentation Creation** \u2014 In progress.\n6. **Provider Abstraction Layer Refactoring** \u2014 Planned (Next).\n",

Current Security Model\n\nThis section describes the security model as it is currently implemented in the codebase.\n\n### 1.1. Admin Endpoint Authentication\nThe most significant security control is the use of a single, **static admin API key** for all administrative operations.\n\n*   **Mechanism:** Clients must provide the pre-configured admin API key in the `X-API-Key` HTTP header.\n*   **Configuration:** The API key is set via the `ADMIN_API_KEY` environment variable or an `.admin_api_key` file.\n*   **Threat Model:** This approach is sufficient to prevent unauthorized access in a trusted, internal-only environment. It is **not** intended to be secure enough for a public-facing service.\n\n### 1.2. Spotify Authentication & Token Storage\nUser-level authentication with the Spotify API is handled via a standard OAuth2 flow.\n\n*   **Risk:** Spotify OAuth tokens (access and refresh) are currently stored in a plain text JSON file (`api/storage/spotify_tokens.json`).\n*   **Mitigation Status:** This is a known high-priority issue. A proper, secure storage solution (e.g., encrypted database or secrets manager) is a requirement for any production-ready deployment.\n\n### 1.3. Transport Security\nAll communication with the API is encrypted using TLS. Certificate management is handled by the hosting provider.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Future Enhancements & Security Roadmap\n\nThis section outlines security features that are planned or designed but **not yet implemented**.\n\n### 2.1. Authentication & Authorization\n*   **Dynamic Admin Key Generation:** Replace the static admin API key with a system for dynamic, auto-generated keys to mitigate risks of a compromised static secret.\n*   **OAuth2 for User Authentication:** Implement a full OAuth2/JWT-based system for end-users of the API, moving beyond the single-admin model.\n*   **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication):** Add an extra layer of security for user accounts.\n*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Create different roles (e.g., admin, user, read-only) with different levels of access.\n\n### 2.2. Secrets Management\n*   **Secure Credential Storage:** Implement secure, encrypted storage for Spotify tokens and other application secrets, replacing the plain text JSON files.\n\n### 2.3. General Hardening\n*   **Rate Limiting:** Introduce rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (e.g., login, playlist creation) to prevent abuse.\n*   **Comprehensive Audit Logging:** Implement a detailed audit logging system to track all security-sensitive events.\n*   **Security Testing:** Establish a process for regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.\n",

    "content": "# Apply the Task Execution Checklist from docs/projectplan/task_checklist.md, ensuring all applicable points are fully covered for this task, including documentation updates across all `.md` files outside excluded directories.\n\n\n# Task Execution Checklist\n\n**Purpose**\nThis checklist must be followed for *every* development task before it is marked complete. It ensures security-by-design, privacy compliance, documentation maintenance, testing discipline, and overall project hygiene.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Task Qualification\n- [ ] **Task Readiness Verification:** Manually confirm the task conforms to the template in `BACKLOG.md` and meets all readiness criteria in `PID.md` before starting work.\n\n## 2. Security\n- Review code changes for **security risks**: injection, data leaks, improper authentication, unsafe file handling.\n- Ensure **admin API key handling** complies with `docs/projectplan/admin_api_key_mitigation.md`.\n- Confirm **least-privilege principle** is applied for endpoints, data access, and dependencies.\n- Add or update **`docs/projectplan/security.md`** with any new security considerations.\n- Verify any new dependencies or third-party components are vetted for security and properly licensed.\n\n## 3. Privacy\n- Review code changes for **privacy compliance** (GDPR, CCPA, or other applicable regulations).\n- Confirm sensitive data is **minimized**, **encrypted** where needed, and **never logged in plain text**.\n- Update **`docs/projectplan/privacy_compliance.md`** reflecting new privacy impacts and controls.\n- Enforce user data rights: consent capture, data export, deletion, correction, and withdrawal mechanisms.\n- Extend audit logging to track all personal data access and changes securely.\n- Integrate privacy by design and default into the task's implementation.\n\n## 4. Documentation \u2014 **Mandatory & Verifiable**\n\nThe task is **not complete** until every item below is satisfied and evidence is committed.\n\n- **HLD & LLD**:\n  - Update or create high-level and low-level design docs if implementation deviates from specs.\n  - Include clear architectural change summaries.\n\n- **Roadmap**:\n  - Update `docs/roadmap.md` or equivalent if timelines, scope, or priorities change.\n\n- **Audit References**:\n  - Update relevant audit documents (e.g., `docs/projectplan/spotify_capability_audit.md`) if impacted.\n\n- **User & Operator Guides**:\n  - Update `developer_guide.md`, `operator_guide.md`, and related manuals for all functional changes, including API examples.\n\n- **CHANGELOG**:\n  - Add entries reflecting **all** functional changes: new/modified/removed endpoints, param changes, behavioral changes.\n\n- **Task Completion Report**:\n  - Produce a detailed report in `docs/projectplan/reports/<taskname>.md` that includes:\n    - Summary of code and architectural changes.\n    - **Documentation review log**: A table listing every file from the Documentation Review File List with a \u201cChanged\u201d or \u201cNo Change\u201d mark plus commit references.\n    - Explicit statement on API documentation updates.\n\n- **Reports Index**:\n  - Update `docs/projectplan/reports/README.md` to reference the new report.\n\n- **Full `.md` File Sweep**:\n  - **Carefully review every file on the Documentation Review File List for needed updates** related to the task.\n  - Apply updates wherever necessary.\n  - Mark each file in the documentation review log regardless of change status.\n\n- **Functional Change Documentation**:\n  - Document all functional changes in every relevant doc: API reference, developer/operator guides, README if user-facing.\n  - Include before/after request/response examples and behavior notes.\n\n- **Verification**:\n  - Task is incomplete without all above deliverables committed and verified.\n\n---\n\nthe files listed in PROJECT_REGISTRY.md\n\n## 5. Tests\n- Write or update **unit tests** covering all new or changed logic, including edge cases and failure modes.\n- Update **integration tests** to reflect new API endpoints, flows, or behavioral changes.\n- Ensure **all tests pass** in continuous integration (CI) and locally before marking task complete.\n- For security- or privacy-sensitive features, write **negative tests** simulating invalid inputs, unauthorized access, or malformed data.\n- Automate running linting, static analysis, security scans, and documentation build tests as part of CI where applicable.\n\n## 6. Code Quality\n- Follow established **naming conventions**, directory structures, and coding style guides strictly.\n- Maintain strict **modularity** \u2014 separate concerns cleanly, avoid cross-layer leakage (e.g., CLI logic leaking into API layer).\n- Ensure complete and correct **type hints** and **docstrings** for all functions, classes, and modules.\n- Perform **code reviews** with a focus on readability, maintainability, performance, and security.\n- Use automated **linters** and **formatters** to enforce consistent style.\n- Where feasible, use static code analysis tools to detect potential bugs or anti-patterns.\n- Consider efficiency, scalability, and resource usage when writing or modifying code.\n- Refactor legacy or autogenerated code as needed to meet these quality standards.\n\n## 7. Automation and Workflow\n- Integrate **explicit approval steps** (code reviews, security/privacy sign-offs) if your project workflow requires them.\n- Include **automated checks** like linting, security scans, and documentation builds as part of task completion validation.\n- Follow a **clear branching and release process** if it can be fully automated as part of the task execution.\n- If the task is fully automatable and no manual review is needed, document this clearly and proceed with direct commits/pushes accordingly.\n\n---\n\n**Enforcement:**\nNo task is considered complete unless all applicable checklist items have been addressed. This file is authoritative and version-controlled.\n\n---\n\n### Notes on Privacy Compliance (Integrated)\nPrivacy compliance is an integral part of every task, not a separate addendum. Ensure:\n- User consent is captured and stored where relevant.\n- API endpoints exposing personal data enforce RBAC and access controls.\n- Data minimization, encryption, and audit logging are applied consistently.\n- User rights such as data export, deletion, and correction are implemented and tested.\n- All privacy-related documentation is updated as part of normal doc maintenance.\n\n---\n\n**Usage:**\nInclude the full content of this checklist as part of your prompt or task instructions to ensure all aspects of security, privacy, documentation, testing, and code quality are covered before task completion.\n",

    "content": "# AUDIT-phase-3: Incremental Design Updates\n\n**Date:** 2025-08-11\n**Author:** Jules\n**Objective:** To track the incremental updates to design documents to bring them into alignment with the codebase reality, as outlined in the HLD/LLD Alignment Plan.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Task: Add and Document CORS Policy\n\n**Date:** 2025-08-13\n**Status:** \u2705 Done\n\n### 10.1. Problem\nDuring testing, the `gonk-testUI` was unable to connect to the Zotify API, despite network connectivity being correct. The root cause was identified as a missing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy on the API server, which caused browsers to block cross-origin requests from the UI. This was a significant design oversight.\n\n### 10.2. Changes Made\n1.  **Code:** Added FastAPI's `CORSMiddleware` to `api/src/zotify_api/main.py` with a permissive default policy (`allow_origins=[\"*\"]`) suitable for local development.\n2.  **Design Docs:** Updated `HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` and `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` to include the new CORS policy as a documented part of the architecture.\n3.  **Audit Docs:** Added a \"CORS Policy\" entry to the main `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` to track this as a formal system requirement.\n4.  **Operator Docs:** Updated `OPERATOR_GUIDE.md` to inform system administrators about the default CORS policy and considerations for production.\n\n### 10.3. Outcome\nThe API now correctly handles cross-origin requests, allowing browser-based tools to function. The design oversight has been corrected in the code and is now fully documented across all relevant project artifacts, closing the gap.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Task: Align Documentation Practices\n\n**Date:** 2025-08-12\n**Status:** \u2705 Done\n\n### 9.1. Problem\nThe `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a high-priority gap for \"Documentation Practices\". The design documents mandated a \"docs-first\" workflow that was not being followed, creating a mismatch between the documented process and the actual process.\n\n### 9.2. Changes Made\n1.  **`HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` Update:** The \"Documentation Governance\" section was rewritten to reflect the current, pragmatic \"living documentation\" process. This new description accurately portrays the project's workflow during the audit and alignment phase.\n2.  **Future Vision:** The updated text explicitly keeps the door open for adopting a more formal \"docs-first\" approach in future phases, once the project's design has stabilized.\n3.  **`AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` Update:** The \"Documentation Practices\" row was updated to `Matches Design? = Y`, closing the final major documentation gap identified in the audit.\n\n### 9.3. Outcome\nThe project's high-level design now accurately reflects its actual documentation processes, resolving the identified gap. This completes the final planned task of the documentation alignment phase.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Task: Align Configuration Management Documentation\n\n**Date:** 2025-08-12\n**Status:** \u2705 Done\n\n### 8.1. Problem\nThe `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a gap for \"Config Management via API\". The documentation was unclear and did not accurately reflect the existing implementation, which turned out to be a dual system for handling configuration.\n\n### 8.2. Changes Made\n1.  **Investigation:** Analyzed `config.py`, `routes/config.py`, and `services/config_service.py` to understand the dual-system approach. Confirmed that core settings are startup-only, while a separate service handles mutable application settings via a JSON file and API.\n2.  **`LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` Update:** Added a new \"Configuration Management\" section to accurately describe the dual system, detailing the purpose, source, and mutability of each.\n3.  **`FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md` Update:** Added the aspirational goal of a \"Unified Configuration Management\" system to the technical enhancements list.\n4.  **`AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` Update:** Updated the \"Config Management via API\" row to `Matches Design? = Y` and added a note clarifying the resolution.\n\n### 8.3. Outcome\nThe project's design documents now accurately reflect the current state of the configuration system. The documentation gap is closed, and the potential for a future, unified system is recorded.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Task: Consolidate Terminology, Scopes, and Processes\n\n**Date:** 2025-08-12\n**Status:** \u2705 Done\n\n### 7.1. Problem\nDuring ongoing work, several small but important alignment tasks were identified:\n1. The term \"Adapter\" was used for the provider abstraction layer, but \"Connector\" was deemed more accurate.\n2. The Spotify integration requested a minimal set of permissions (scopes), limiting its potential functionality.\n3. The process for handling postponed tasks was undefined, leading to clutter in the `ACTIVITY.md` log.\n4. Obsolete storage directories and files were present in the repository.\n\n### 7.2. Changes Made\n1.  **Terminology Refactor:** The term \"Adapter\" was replaced with \"Connector\" across all code, documentation, and project management files.\n2.  **Scope Expansion:** The Spotify authorization request was updated to include all standard scopes, enabling the broadest possible functionality.\n3.  **Process Formalization:** New rules were added to `PID.md` and `CURRENT_STATE.md` to formalize the handling of postponed tasks and the requirement to log all significant changes in documentation. The status of a blocked task in `ACTIVITY.md` was updated to `Obsolete`.\n4.  **Storage Cleanup:** Redundant storage directories and obsolete `.json` data files were removed from the repository.\n\n### 7.3. Outcome\nThe project's terminology is now more consistent, its capabilities are expanded, and its development processes are more clearly defined and documented. The repository is cleaner and more aligned with the current architecture.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Task: Implement Unified Database Architecture\n\n**Date:** 2025-08-11\n**Status:** \u2705 Done\n\n### 6.1. Problem\nThe application used multiple, inconsistent persistence mechanisms, including file-based storage (`playlists.json`, `spotify_tokens.json`) and a single-purpose SQLite database for downloads. This was not scalable, secure, or maintainable. A unified, backend-agnostic database layer was required.\n\n### 6.2. Changes Made\n1.  **Architectural Refactoring:**\n    *   A new database layer was created at `api/src/zotify_api/database/` using SQLAlchemy.\n    *   This layer includes a configurable session manager, ORM models for all application data, and a set of CRUD functions.\n2.  **Service Migration:**\n    *   The Download Service, Playlist Storage, and Spotify Token Storage were all refactored to use the new unified database layer.\n    *   The old persistence mechanisms (JSON files, standalone SQLite DB) were removed.\n3.  **Testing:**\n    *   The test suite was updated to use the new database architecture, with isolated in-memory databases for each test run.\n4.  **Documentation:**\n    *   The `HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md`, `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md`, and `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` were all updated to reflect the new architecture.\n\n### 6.3. Outcome\nThe application now has a robust, centralized, and backend-agnostic persistence layer. This improves scalability, maintainability, and security, and provides a solid foundation for future development.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Task: Implement Persistent Download Queue\n\n**Date:** 2025-08-11\n**Status:** \u2705 Done\n\n### 5.1. Problem\nThe `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a high-priority gap for the \"Downloads Subsystem\". The initial implementation used a temporary, in-memory queue, which was not suitable for production.\n\n### 5.2. Changes Made\n1.  **Code Implementation:**\n    *   Created a new database module `api/src/zotify_api/services/downloads_db.py` to manage a persistent queue using SQLite.\n    *   Refactored `api/src/zotify_api/services/download_service.py` to use the new database module, replacing the in-memory queue.\n2.  **Testing:**\n    *   Updated the test suite in `api/tests/test_download.py` to use a temporary, isolated database for each test, ensuring the new implementation is robustly tested.\n3.  **Documentation Updates:**\n    *   Updated `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` to describe the new SQLite-based persistent queue.\n    *   Updated `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` to mark the \"Downloads Subsystem\" gap as fully closed (`Matches Design? = Y`).\n\n### 5.3. Outcome\nThe \"Downloads Subsystem\" now has a production-ready, persistent job queue. This closes a critical, high-priority gap identified in the audit.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Task: Align Admin Endpoint Security Documentation\n\n**Date:** 2025-08-11\n**Status:** \u2705 Done\n\n### 1.1. Problem\n\nThe `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a high-priority gap for \"Admin Endpoint Security\". The existing design documents were pointing to a non-existent `security.md` file and contained outdated information about the security model.\n\n### 1.2. Changes Made\n\n1.  **Created `docs/projectplan/security.md`:** A new, definitive security document was created by copying the archived (pre-audit) version and updating it to reflect the current implementation.\n    *   The document now clearly separates the **Current Security Model** (static admin API key) from the **Future Enhancements** (JWT, rate limiting, etc.).\n2.  **Updated `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`:** The entry for \"Admin Endpoint Security\" was updated to `Matches Design? = Y`, closing the documentation gap.\n3.  **Updated `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md`:** The plan was updated to mark the beginning of Phase 3.\n\n### 1.3. Outcome\n\nThe project's security documentation is now accurate and aligned with the current state of the codebase. This completes the first task of Phase 3.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Task: Implement Downloads Subsystem Queue Processor\n\n**Date:** 2025-08-11\n**Status:** \u2705 Done\n\n### 2.1. Problem\n\nThe `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a high-priority gap for the \"Downloads Subsystem\". The design specified a functional job queue, but the codebase only contained stubs.\n\n### 2.2. Changes Made\n\n1.  **Code Implementation:**\n    *   Added `process_download_queue()` method to `DownloadsService` to process one job from the queue.\n    *   Added a manual trigger endpoint `POST /api/download/process`.\n    *   Fixed a bug in the `retry_failed_jobs` logic.\n2.  **Testing:**\n    *   Added a comprehensive test suite for the new functionality. All project tests pass.\n3.  **Documentation Updates:**\n    *   Updated `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` to reflect the new implementation.\n    *   Updated `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` to mark the gap as partially closed.\n    *   Updated `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` and `ROADMAP.md` to reflect the progress.\n\n### 2.3. Outcome\n\nThe \"Downloads Subsystem\" now has a functional, in-memory job queue, closing the initial implementation gap. This completes this task as another item in the Alignment Plan's Phase 3.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Task: Align Error Handling & Logging Documentation\n\n**Date:** 2025-08-11\n**Status:** \u2705 Done\n\n### 3.1. Problem\n\nThe `AUDIT_AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a medium-priority gap for \"Error Handling & Logging\". The implementation was inconsistent and did not match the ideal design of standardized error schemas and audit trails.\n\n### 3.2. Changes Made\n\n1.  **Investigation:** Analyzed the codebase to document the current ad-hoc implementation of error handling and logging.\n2.  **`FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`:** Added the \"ideal\" design for standardized error handling and logging to this document.\n3.  **`LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md`:** Added a new design section to accurately describe the current, inconsistent implementation.\n4.  **`AUDIT_AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`:** Updated the entry for \"Error Handling & Logging\" to `Matches Design? = Y`, closing the documentation gap.\n\n### 3.3. Outcome\n\nThe project's design documents now accurately reflect the current state of the error handling and logging system. The aspirational, standardized design is captured as a future goal. This completes this task as another item in the Alignment Plan's Phase 3.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Task: Align OAuth2 for Spotify Integration Documentation\n\n**Date:** 2025-08-11\n**Status:** \u2705 Done\n\n### 4.1. Problem\n\nThe `AUDIT_AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` identified a medium-priority gap for \"OAuth2 for Spotify Integration\". The design specified full CRUD/sync functionality, but the implementation was incomplete.\n\n### 4.2. Changes Made\n\n1.  **Investigation:** Analyzed the `spotify` service and client to determine the exact capabilities of the current integration. Confirmed that playlist CRUD is functional, but write-sync and full library management are not implemented.\n2.  **`FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`:** Updated the entry for \"Full Spotify OAuth2 Integration\" to be more specific about the missing features (write-sync, full library management).\n3.  **`LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md`:** Added a new design section to accurately describe the current, partial implementation.\n4.  **`AUDIT_AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`:** Updated the entry for \"OAuth2 for Spotify Integration\" to `Matches Design? = Y (partial)`, closing the documentation gap.\n\n### 4.3. Outcome\n\nThe project's design documents now accurately reflect the current state of the Spotify integration. The unimplemented features are captured as future goals. This completes this task as another item in the Alignment Plan's Phase 3.\n",

    "content": "# Audit Phase 4: Findings and Final Plan (Condensed)\n\nThis document summarizes the findings from the code audit and test suite restoration.\n\n## 1. Findings\n\n*   **Outdated Documentation:** Project status documents were inaccurate. The \"Generic Error Handling Module\" was found to be fully implemented, contrary to the documentation.\n*   **Broken Test Suite:** The test suite was non-functional due to environment, configuration, and obsolete code issues.\n*   **Code-Level Bugs:** After repairing the test suite, 50 test failures were identified and fixed. Key issues included:\n    *   Database initialization errors.\n    *   Poor test isolation practices (improper use of `dependency_overrides.clear()`).\n    *   Missing mocks for external services, causing unintended network calls.\n    *   A bug in the error handler's singleton implementation.\n\n## 2. Outcome\n\nThe project is now in a stable state with a fully passing test suite (135/135 tests).\n\n## 3. Proposed Next Steps\n\n*   Complete the partial webhook implementation.\n*   Refactor the provider abstraction to remove a temporary hack.\n*   Update all project documentation to reflect the current state of the code.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Session Report (2025-08-15): Documentation and Process Hardening\n\nThis session focused on interpreting and strengthening the project's documentation and development processes.\n\n### 4.1. Documentation Policy Interpretation\n- A deep dive was conducted into the project's documentation policies by analyzing `PID.md`, `HLD.md`, `LLD.md`, and the audit trail.\n- The core policy was identified as \"living documentation,\" requiring docs to be updated in lock-step with code.\n- Key enforcement gaps were identified, such as the missing `TASK_CHECKLIST.md`.\n\n### 4.2. Process Implementation: Task Backlog Mechanism\nA new, formal \"Task Backlog Mechanism\" was implemented to enforce stricter process discipline.\n- **`BACKLOG.md`:** Overwritten with a new structured template, requiring tasks to have a source, acceptance criteria, dependencies, etc.\n- **`PID.md`:** Updated to formally document the new rules for backlog management and task qualification.\n- **`TASK_CHECKLIST.md`:** Updated with a new mandatory \"Task Qualification\" step, requiring developers to manually verify a task's readiness against the new rules before starting work.\n- **`PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`:** Updated to reflect the new, more formal backlog process.\n\n### 4.3. Documentation Cleanup\n- The missing `TASK_CHECKLIST.md` was located in the `project/archive` and restored to `project/`.\n- The outdated, hardcoded file list within `TASK_CHECKLIST.md` was removed and replaced with a reference to the `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Session Report (2025-08-17): Audit Verification and Backlog Formalization\n\nThis session focused on verifying the audit findings from the developer brief and formalizing the project's next steps in the backlog.\n\n### 5.1. Audit Verification\nA deep verification of the audit findings was performed to \"establish reality\" before proceeding with the main execution plan.\n- **Logging System:** Confirmed that the implementation in `api/src/zotify_api/services/logging_service.py` is a placeholder and does not match the approved design. **Finding is correct.**\n- **Error Handling Module:** Confirmed that the module is fully implemented in `api/src/zotify_api/core/error_handler/` and that the statement in `project/ACTIVITY.md` about the implementation being \"lost\" is incorrect. **Finding is correct.**\n- **Test Suite Environment:** Confirmed that the test suite is broken out-of-the-box. It requires the manual, undocumented steps of creating `api/storage` and setting the environment variable `APP_ENV=development` to pass. After performing these steps, all 135 tests passed successfully. **Finding is correct.**\n\n### 5.2. Backlog Formalization\n- **`BACKLOG.md`:** Updated to remove obsolete `LOG-TASK-` entries from the previous design phase.\n- Two new, high-priority tasks were added to drive the next phase of work:\n    - `REM-TASK-01`: To perform documentation/environment remediation.\n    - `LOG-TASK-01`: To implement the new logging system.\n\n### 5.3. Environment and Documentation Remediation\n- The `.gitignore` file was updated to ignore the `api/storage` directory and local database files.\n- The `INSTALLATION.md` guide was updated to include the missing manual setup steps required to run the test suite.\n- The `ACTIVITY.md` log was corrected to accurately reflect the status of the Error Handling Module.\n\n### 5.4. Error Handler Refactoring\n- The `TriggerManager` was refactored to support pluggable, dynamically loaded actions.\n- The `ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md` was updated to reflect the new, simpler process for adding actions.\n- All unit tests were confirmed to pass after the refactoring.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Addendum (2025-08-17): Post-Integration Verification\n\nThis section serves as a correction to the findings listed in Section 5.1.\n\n### 6.1. Correction of Previous Audit Findings\n\nA deeper investigation was conducted as part of the work for `LOG-TASK-01`. This investigation revealed that the initial \"Audit Verification\" was based on incomplete information.\n\n-   **Logging System:** The finding that the logging system was a \"placeholder\" is **incorrect**. A thorough code review found that all major components of the new logging system (including the `LoggingService`, all three handlers, the `JobLog` database model, the YAML configuration, and a full suite of unit tests) were already fully implemented in the codebase. The task, therefore, shifted from \"implementation\" to \"integration and verification.\" The system has now been successfully integrated into the application's startup lifecycle.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Session Report (2025-08-17): Final Documentation Overhaul\n\nThis session focused on resolving all remaining documentation gaps and ensuring the project's documentation is fully aligned with the codebase.\n\n### 7.1. Master Endpoint Reference\n- A new canonical endpoint reference, `project/ENDPOINTS.md`, was created to address a compliance gap and serve as a single source of truth for all API endpoints.\n\n### 7.2. Documentation Restoration\n- Several critical documents (`full_api_reference.md`, `PRIVACY_COMPLIANCE.md`, `phase5-ipc.md`) were restored from the project archive and placed in their correct locations.\n- The `project/ENDPOINTS.md` file was updated to link to these restored documents.\n\n### 7.3. Project Registry Audit\n- A full audit of the `project/PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` file was conducted.\n- The registry was updated to include all markdown documents for the `api`, `snitch`, and `gonk-testUI` modules, as well as all critical project-level and audit-level documents. The registry is now considered complete and accurate.\n",

Incomplete auth flow description, useless endpoint list with no details, and an incorrect manual test runbook. |\n| **`./docs/projectplan/`** | | |\n| `./docs/projectplan/admin_api_key_mitigation.md` | \u274c **Inaccurate (Aspirational)** | Describes a detailed design for a dynamic API key system that was never implemented. |\n| `./docs/projectplan/admin_api_key_security_risk.md`| \u2705 **Accurate** | Accurately describes the current, risky implementation of the static admin API key. One of the few honest planning documents. |\n| `./docs/projectplan/doc_maintenance.md` | \u274c **Fictional (Process)** | Describes a disciplined, documentation-centric workflow that is the polar opposite of what actually happened. |\n| `./docs/projectplan/HLD_Zotify_API.md` | \u26a0\ufe0f **Partially Inaccurate** | The architectural overview is accurate, but the sections on process, governance, and documentation are pure fantasy. |\n| `./docs/projectplan/LLD_18step_plan_Zotify_API.md` | \u274c **Falsified Record** | A complete work of fiction. Falsely claims an 18-step plan is complete. Contains multiple conflicting roadmaps. The most misleading file in the project. |\n| `./docs/projectplan/next_steps_and_phases.md` | \u274c **Fictional and Contradictory** | The third conflicting roadmap.

Describes a detailed, disciplined development process that was completely ignored. |\n| `./docs/projectplan/security.md` | \u26a0\ufe0f **Partially Inaccurate** | Accurately identifies critical security flaws (e.g., plaintext token storage) but frames them as future roadmap items instead of immediate vulnerabilities. |\n| `./docs/projectplan/spotify_capability_audit.md` | \u2705 **Accurate (Superseded)** | Correctly states that it is superseded and points to the new document. Should be archived. |\n| `./docs/projectplan/spotify_fullstack_capability_blueprint.md`| \u274c **Inaccurate (Aspirational)** | A massive, ambitious design blueprint that was almost completely ignored during implementation. The API structure and namespacing do not match this plan. |\n| `./docs/projectplan/spotify_gap_alignment_report.md`| \u274c **Fictional and Contradictory**| Falsely marks non-existent features as \"Done\" and contradicts other planning documents it claims to align with. |\n| `./docs/projectplan/task_checklist.md` | \u2705 **Accurate (but Ignored)** | The checklist itself is a clear set of instructions.

The actual implementation is completely different. |\n| **`./api/docs/`** | | |\n| `./api/docs/CHANGELOG.md` | \u26a0\ufe0f **Inaccurate (Incomplete)** | Contains some recent entries but is missing many significant changes and does not follow a consistent format. |\n| `./api/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` | \u26a0\ufe0f **Inaccurate** | Specifies the wrong linter (`pylint` instead of `ruff`) and contains a broken link to a non-existent \"Testing Criteria\" section. |\n| `./api/docs/DATABASE.md` | \u26a0\ufe0f **Mostly Accurate (Incomplete)** | Accurately describes the *architecture* for DB support but fails to mention that no DB is configured by default and provides no schema/migration info. |\n| `./api/docs/INSTALLATION.md` | \u26a0\ufe0f **Incomplete (Stub)** | Provides accurate instructions for manual developer setup but contains empty placeholders for three other installation methods (Script, .deb, Docker). |\n| `./api/docs/MANUAL.md` | \u274c **Critically Inaccurate** | Unusable. Incomplete auth flow description, useless endpoint list with no details, incorrect test runbook, and wrong port number. |\n| `./api/docs/full_api_reference.md` | \u274c **Critically Inaccurate** | Unusable.

It is actively harmful, misleading, and contradictory. More time appears to have been spent writing fictional plans and processes than was spent following them.\n\n**My advice is to declare \"documentation bankruptcy.\"** The existing planning documents are unsalvageable and untrustworthy.\n\n### **Recommended Action Plan**\n\n**Step 1: Archive the Fiction (Immediate)**\n*   **Action:** Create a new directory `docs/archive` and move almost the entire contents of `docs/projectplan`, `docs/snitch`, and `snitch/docs` into it. These documents are toxic assets and must be removed from the main project view to prevent further confusion.\n*   **Rationale:** The current documentation is worse than no documentation. It actively wastes developer time and creates false impressions about the project's status, architecture, and processes. Archiving it is the first step to establishing a new, reliable source of truth.\n\n**Step 2: Establish a Minimal, Trustworthy Core**\n*   **Action:** Create a new, single `README.md` in the root directory that is 100% accurate. It should cover:\n    1.  A brief, honest description of the project's purpose.\n    2.  Correct, verifiable installation and setup instructions.\n    3.  A simple, correct guide to the authentication flow (`X-API-Key`).\n    4.  A link to the auto-generated OpenAPI documentation (`/docs`) as the **single source of truth for all API endpoints**. Explicitly state that all other API reference documents are deprecated.\n*   **Rationale:** Developers need a single, reliable entry point. All effort should be focused on making this one file perfect before attempting to document anything else.\n\n**Step 3: Address Critical Codebase Risks**\n*   **Action:** Create a new, focused plan to address the security risks identified in `docs/projectplan/security.md`, which was one of the few accurate documents.\n    1.  **HIGH PRIORITY:** Implement secure, encrypted storage for the Spotify OAuth tokens. Storing them in a plaintext JSON file is a critical vulnerability.\n    2.  Implement proper authentication and authorization for all endpoints that handle user data (e.g., the `notifications` endpoints).\n*   **Rationale:** The codebase has known, documented, high-priority security flaws that should be addressed before any new features are considered.\n\n**Step 4: Re-evaluate the Project's Goals**\n*   **Action:** After the codebase is secured and a minimal, accurate README is in place, a new planning process should begin. This should start with a simple, high-level roadmap, not a complex, multi-layered set of fictional documents.\n*   **Rationale:** The project needs to restart its planning process from a foundation of reality, not fantasy.\n",

The audit in Phase 1 confirmed that these disciplined, documentation-first workflows were not followed.\n    *   **Outdated Mitigations:** The risk mitigation described in \"Section 8\" (`PR checklist and CI step that flags doc inconsistencies`) is not implemented.\n\n---\n\n## 2. `LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` Analysis\n\nThis document was intended to describe the specific work items for an \"18-step service-layer refactor.\"\n\n*   **Alignment:**\n    *   The technical guidance in the \"Refactor Standards\" section (e.g., how to structure a service, where to put tests) is technically sound and provides a good template for development work.\n\n*   **Discrepancies:**\n    *   **Falsified Record:** The \"Step Breakdown\" section is a falsified record. It claims the 18-step refactor is \"All steps completed,\" which is verifiably false. The audit and our new `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` confirm that several API endpoints are still stubs or only partially implemented.\n    *   **Obsolete and Conflicting Plans:** The document contains two additional, conflicting roadmaps (\"Security Roadmap\" and \"Multi-Phase Plan Beyond Step 18\"). These plans are completely misaligned with our canonical `ROADMAP.md` and `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` and should be considered obsolete.\n    *   **Fictional Processes:** Like the HLD, the sections on \"Task Workflow / Checklist Enforcement\" describe a process that was never followed.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Recommendations (from initial analysis)\n\nThe HLD and LLD documents contain a mixture of useful technical guidance and highly inaccurate, obsolete project management information.\n\n*   **HLD:** The architectural overview is valuable.\n*   **LLD:** The \"Refactor Standards\" section provides a useful technical template.\n*   **Problem:** Both documents are polluted with fictional processes, falsified status claims, and obsolete plans that directly contradict our new canonical planning documents.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nA future task should be created to refactor the HLD and LLD to serve as pure technical design documents by stripping all project management content. All active planning and status tracking should remain exclusively in `ROADMAP.md` and `EXECUTION_PLAN.md`.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Summary of Implemented Core Functionalities (Task 1.2)\n\nBased on a review of the `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` and the `AUDIT-phase-1.md` report, the following core functionalities are considered implemented and functional:\n\n*   **Project Foundation:**\n    *   Repository structure and CI/CD pipelines (ruff, mypy, pytest).\n    *   FastAPI application skeleton with a modular structure.\n*   **Core API Endpoints:**\n    *   Albums, Tracks, and Metadata retrieval.\n    *   Notifications (CRUD operations).\n    *   User Profile management (profile, preferences, etc.).\n    *   Search functionality.\n    *   System info (`/uptime`, `/env`).\n*   **Spotify Integration:**\n    *   Authentication and token management (OAuth2 flow).\n    *   Playlist management (CRUD operations).\n    *   Library sync (read-only fetching).\n*   **Testing:**\n    *   A comprehensive Pytest suite is in place and passes consistently.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Phase 2 Conclusion\n\n**Date:** 2025-08-11\n**Author:** Jules\n\nThis document summarizes the analysis of the HLD/LLD alignment and the state of the codebase at the conclusion of Phase 1 of the audit. The key findings were the significant drift between the design documents and the implementation, and the presence of obsolete and inaccurate project management information within the HLD and LLD.\n\nThe primary outcome of this phase was the creation of the `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`, which serves as the blueprint for the alignment work in Phase 3.\n\nWith the completion of this analysis, Phase 2 is now considered complete. The project will now transition to Phase 3: Incremental Design Updates.\n",

Purpose & Scope\n\nThis document provides a detailed, step-by-step action plan for implementing the \"Super-Lint,\" a comprehensive code quality and security enforcement mechanism for the Zotify API project. This plan synthesizes the best elements of previous proposals to create a single, authoritative guide.\n\n### 1.1. Scope\n- **Codebases Covered:** The Super-Lint will apply to all Python code within the `api/` directory and all Go code within the `snitch/` directory.\n- **Goals:**\n    - Automate the enforcement of coding standards and style.\n    - Proactively identify security vulnerabilities and insecure dependencies.\n    - Automatically enforce \"living documentation\" policies.\n    - Ensure a consistent and high level of code quality to improve long-term maintainability.\n\n## 2. Tools & Standards\n\n### 2.1. Chosen Tools\n- **Python:**\n    - **`ruff`:** For high-performance linting and formatting.\n    - **`mypy`:** For strict static type checking.\n    - **`bandit`:** For security-focused static analysis.\n    - **`safety`:** For scanning dependencies for known vulnerabilities.\n- **Go:**\n    - **`golangci-lint`:** An aggregator for many Go linters.\n    - **`gosec`:** For security-focused static analysis.\n- **General:**\n    - **`pre-commit`:** A framework to manage and run git hooks for local enforcement.\n\n### 2.2. Coding Standards\n- **Python:** Adherence to PEP 8 (enforced by `ruff`). Strict typing enforced by `mypy`.\n- **Go:** Standard Go formatting (`gofmt`) and best practices enforced by `golangci-lint`.\n- **Compliance Targets:** All new code must pass all Super-Lint checks to be merged.\n\n## 3. Phased Rollout Strategy\n\nThe Super-Lint will be rolled out in phases to manage the remediation of existing technical debt and to introduce checks progressively.\n\n### Phase 4a: Prerequisite: Technical Debt Remediation\nBefore implementing new quality gates, the existing codebase must be brought to a clean baseline.\n- **TD-TASK-01:** Resolve `mypy` Blocker (e.g., conflicting module names).\n- **TD-TASK-02:** Remediate Critical Security Vulnerabilities identified by an initial `bandit` scan.\n- **TD-TASK-03:** Establish baseline configurations for all tools (`ruff.toml`, `mypy.ini`, `.golangci.yml`).\n\n### Phase 4b: Foundational Static Analysis\n- **Goal:** Automatically enforce baseline code quality, style, and security.\n- **Tasks:**\n    - **SL-TASK-01:** Integrate `ruff`, `mypy`, `bandit`, and `golangci-lint` into the CI pipeline in \"advisory mode\" (reports errors but does not block merges).\n    - **SL-TASK-02:** After a review period, switch the CI pipeline to \"enforcement mode,\" blocking merges on any failure.\n\n### Phase 4c: Custom Architectural & Documentation Linting\n- **Goal:** Automatically enforce the project's \"living documentation\" philosophy.\n- **Tasks:**\n    - **SL-TASK-03:** Develop a custom linting script for the CI pipeline to:\n        1. Verify new API routes are documented.\n        2. Verify significant new logic is linked to a feature specification.\n        3. Check for the presence of docstrings on all public functions/classes.\n        4. Flag PRs that modify core logic but do not update `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`.\n\n### Phase 4d: Deep Code Review Process & Local Enforcement\n- **Goal:** Formalize the human review process and provide immediate local feedback.\n- **Tasks:**\n    - **SL-TASK-04:** Update `TASK_CHECKLIST.md` with a formal code review checklist based on the Super-Lint requirements (Maintainability, Performance, etc.) and a code scoring rubric.\n    - **SL-TASK-05:** Implement `pre-commit` hooks to run `ruff` and `golangci-lint` locally, providing instant feedback to developers before code is even committed.\n\n## 4. Exemption Process\n\nIn rare cases where a rule must be violated, the following process is required:\n1.  The line of code must be marked with a specific `# noqa: [RULE-ID]` comment.\n2.  A justification for the exemption must be added to the code comment and the Pull Request description.\n3.  The exemption must be explicitly approved by a senior developer during code review.\n\n## 5. Traceability\n- This plan is the primary deliverable for the \"Define the Detailed Action Plan for Phase 4 'Super-Lint'\" task.\n- Implementation will be tracked via `TD-TASK-*` and `SL-TASK-*` entries in `BACKLOG.md`.\n- Overall progress will be reflected in `ROADMAP.md`.\n",

    "content": "# **FIRST_AUDIT: Comprehensive API & Documentation Reality Audit**\n\n**Date:** 2025-08-10\n**Author:** Jules\n**Objective:** To provide a definitive, unvarnished, and brutally honest analysis of the Zotify API's current implementation versus its documented design, plans, and specifications. This document serves as the new, single source of truth and baseline for all future project planning and development.\n\n---\n\n## **Part 0: Conclusion of Audit Process**\n\nThis audit was conducted in multiple stages. Initial attempts were insufficient as I, the agent, made incorrect assumptions and took shortcuts by not reviewing every specified document. This led to incomplete and contradictory reports, which rightfully caused a loss of trust.\n\nThis final report is the result of a complete restart of the audit process, executed with the meticulous, file-by-file diligence originally requested. I have now read and analyzed every code file and every documentation file on the review list to produce this report.\n\nMy conclusion is that my own previous failures in reporting were a symptom of a larger project problem: the project's documentation is so fragmented and contradictory that it is impossible to gain an accurate understanding without a deep, forensic analysis of the entire repository. This report provides that analysis. There are no further angles to explore; this is the complete picture.\n\n---\n\n## **Part 1: The Reality \u2014 Codebase & Functional Audit**\n\nThis section establishes the ground truth of what has actually been built.\n\n### **1.1: Complete API Endpoint Inventory**\n\nThe following ~80 endpoints are defined in the FastAPI application. Their documentation status refers to their presence in the official `zotify-openapi-external-v1.yaml` spec.\n\n| Endpoint | Method(s) | Status | Documented? | Function |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `/ping` | GET | \u2705 Functional | No | Basic health check. |\n| `/health` | GET | \u2705 Functional | No | Basic health check. |\n| `/version` | GET | \u2705 Functional | No | Returns application version info. |\n| `/openapi.json` | GET | \u2705 Functional | No | Auto-generated by FastAPI. |\n| `/api/schema` | GET | \u2705 Functional | No | Returns OpenAPI schema components. |\n| `/api/auth/spotify/callback`| POST | \u2705 Functional | No | Primary, secure OAuth callback. |\n| `/api/auth/status` | GET | \u2705 Functional | No | Checks current Spotify auth status. |\n| `/api/auth/logout` | POST | \u2705 Functional | No | Clears local Spotify tokens. |\n| `/api/auth/refresh` | GET | \u2705 Functional | No | Refreshes Spotify auth token. |\n| `/api/spotify/login` | GET | \u2705 Functional | No | Generates Spotify login URL. |\n| `/api/spotify/callback` | GET | \u26a0\ufe0f **Redundant** | No | Legacy, insecure OAuth callback. |\n| `/api/spotify/token_status`| GET | \u2705 Functional | No | Checks local token validity. |\n| `/api/spotify/sync_playlists`| POST | \u2705 Functional | No | Fetches and saves all user playlists. |\n| `/api/spotify/playlists`| GET, POST | \u2705 Functional | No | List or create Spotify playlists. |\n| `/api/spotify/playlists/{id}`| GET, PUT, DELETE | \u2705 Functional | No | Get, update, or unfollow a playlist. |\n| `/api/spotify/playlists/{id}/tracks`| GET, POST, DELETE | \u2705 Functional | No | Get, add, or remove tracks from a playlist. |\n| `/api/spotify/me` | GET | \u2705 Functional | No | Gets current user's Spotify profile. |\n| `/api/spotify/devices` | GET | \u2705 Functional | No | Gets user's available Spotify devices. |\n| `/api/search` | GET | \u2705 Functional | **Yes** | Searches Spotify for content. |\n| `/api/tracks/metadata`| POST | \u2705 Functional | No | Gets metadata for multiple tracks. |\n| `/api/system/uptime` | GET | \u2705 Functional | No | Returns server uptime. |\n| `/api/system/env` | GET | \u2705 Functional | No | Returns server environment info. |\n| `/api/system/status` | GET | \u274c **Stub** | No | Stub for system status. |\n| `/api/system/storage`| GET | \u274c **Stub** | No | Stub for storage info. |\n| `/api/system/logs` | GET | \u274c **Stub** | No | Stub for system logs. |\n| `/api/system/reload` | POST | \u274c **Stub** | No | Stub for config reload. |\n| `/api/system/reset` | POST | \u274c **Stub** | No | Stub for system reset. |\n| `/api/download` | POST | \u274c **Stub** | **Yes** | Stub for downloading a track. |\n| `GET /api/download/status`| GET | \u274c **Stub** | **Yes** | Stub for checking download status. |\n| `/api/downloads/status`| GET | \u2705 **Functional** | No | Gets status of local download queue. |\n| `/api/downloads/retry` | POST | \u2705 **Functional** | No | Retries failed downloads in local queue. |\n| *Other CRUD endpoints*| *various* | \u2705 **Functional** | No | All other endpoints under `/api/cache`, `/api/config`, `/api/logging`, `/api/metadata`, `/api/network`, `/api/notifications`, `/api/playlists`, `/api/tracks`, `/api/user`, and `/api/webhooks` are simple CRUD wrappers around local services and are functional. |\n\n### **1.2: Complete Code File Inventory**\n\nThis table lists every code file, its purpose, and whether it is internally documented with docstrings.\n\n| File Path | Purpose | Documented? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **`zotify/` (CLI Tool - Out of Scope for Docs)** | | |\n| `./zotify/*.py` | Core logic for the original Zotify CLI tool. | \ud83d\udfe1 Partial |\n| **`snitch/` (Go Helper App)** | | |\n| `./snitch/**/*.go`| A helper service for handling OAuth callbacks securely. | \ud83d\udfe1 Partial |\n| **`api/` (Zotify API)** | | |\n| `./api/src/zotify_api/main.py` | FastAPI application entrypoint and router configuration. | \u2705 Yes |\n| `./api/src/zotify_api/auth_state.py`| Manages global auth state and token storage. | \u2705 Yes |\n| `./api/src/zotify_api/config.py` | Handles application settings via Pydantic. | \u2705 Yes |\n| `./api/src/zotify_api/globals.py`| Stores global variables like app start time. | \u2705 Yes |\n| `./api/src/zotify_api/logging_config.py`| Configures application logging. | \u2705 Yes |\n| `./api/src/zotify_api/middleware/request_id.py`| Middleware for adding a request ID to logs. | \u2705 Yes |\n| `./api/src/zotify_api/services/spoti_client.py`| **CRITICAL:** Central client for all Spotify API communication. | \u2705 Yes |\n| `./api/src/zotify_api/services/*.py`| All other service files contain business logic for their respective modules. | \ud83d\udfe1 Partial |\n| `./api/src/zotify_api/routes/*.py`| All route files define API endpoints and delegate to services. | \ud83d\udfe1 Partial |\n| `./api/src/zotify_api/schemas/*.py`| All schema files define Pydantic models for API validation. | \u2705 Yes |\n| `./api/tests/**/*.py` | All test files for the API. | \u2705 Yes |\n\n---\n\n## **Part 2: The Expectation \u2014 Documentation Deep Dive**\n\nThis is a file-by-file analysis of the project's documentation, comparing it to the reality of the codebase.\n\n| File Path | Role in Docs | Status | Gap Analysis |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **`./README.md`** | Project Entrypoint | \u274c **Critically Inaccurate** | Fails to mention the mandatory `X-API-Key` authentication, making the API unusable for a new user. |\n| **`./api/docs/CHANGELOG.md`** | Release Notes | \u26a0\ufe0f **Contradictory** | While recent entries are accurate, its history conflicts with other planning documents, creating a confusing project timeline. |\n| **`./api/docs/zotify-openapi-external-v1.yaml`** | API Contract | \u274c **Useless** | Documents only 3 of ~80 endpoints. Two of those are stubs. This file is dangerously misleading and should be deleted. |\n| **`./docs/developer_guide.md`** | Developer Onboarding | \u274c **Critically Inaccurate** | Contains incorrect information about response formats, endpoint paths, and is missing entire feature sets (e.g., playlists). |\n| **`./docs/projectplan/HLD_Zotify_API.md`**| High-Level Architecture | \u26a0\ufe0f **Inaccurate** | Describes an ideal process (\"documentation-first\") that has failed. The described architecture is now *mostly* correct due to recent work, but the document doesn't reflect this reality. |\n| **`./docs/projectplan/LLD_18step_plan_Zotify_API.md`** | Low-Level Plan | \u274c **False** | The central checklist in this document is falsified, marking work as complete that was never done. It should be archived immediately. |\n| **`./docs/projectplan/next_steps_and_phases.md`** | Project Roadmap | \u274c **Fictional** | Contains a third, conflicting roadmap and claims recently completed work is \"Not Started\". Mandates a process that was never followed. Should be archived. |\n| **`./docs/projectplan/spotify_fullstack_capability_blueprint.md`** | Strategic Vision | \u26a0\ufe0f **Outdated** | Proposes an architecture (namespacing) that was never implemented and has an outdated view of feature completion. |\n| **`./docs/projectplan/spotify_gap_alignment_report.md`** | Strategic Analysis | \u274c **Contradictory** | Conflicts with the Blueprint and reality. Claims features are out of scope that other documents prioritize. Should be archived. |\n| **`./docs/projectplan/privacy_compliance.md`** | Compliance Doc | \u274c **Inaccurate** | Claims features like `/privacy/data` endpoints exist when they do not. |\n| **`./docs/projectplan/task_checklist.md`** | Process Control | \u2705 **Accurate** | This file has been kept up-to-date with the latest, most rigorous process requirements. |\n| **All Other `.md` files** | Ancillary Docs | \u2705 **Accurate** | Files like `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `INSTALLATION.md`, and `snitch/` docs are self-contained and do not conflict with the codebase reality, though they lack integration with a central guide. |\n\n---\n\n## **Part 3: Final Advice & Recommendations**\n\nThe project is at a critical inflection point. The codebase is salvageable and now has a solid architectural foundation. The documentation and planning process, however, is broken and must be rebuilt from a new baseline of truth.\n\n**My advice is to treat the project's documentation as a high-priority technical debt and pay it down immediately.**\n\n### **Recommended Action Plan**\n\n**Step 1: Erase the False History (Immediate)**\n*   **Action:** Create a new directory `docs/archive` and move the following misleading files into it:\n    *   `docs/projectplan/LLD_18step_plan_Zotify_API.md`\n    *   `docs/projectplan/spotify_gap_alignment_report.md`\n    *   `docs/projectplan/next_steps_and_phases.md`\n    *   `docs/projectplan/spotify_capability_audit.md`\n    *   `api/docs/zotify-openapi-external-v1.yaml` (and its `.json` counterpart)\n*   **Rationale:** This immediately removes the sources of confusion and contradiction, forcing the team to rely on a smaller, more manageable set of documents that can be fixed.\n\n**Step 2: Establish a Single Source of Truth (Next)**\n*   **Action:** Overhaul `docs/roadmap.md` to be the **single, authoritative roadmap**. Remove all other phase plans. Update it to reflect the *true* state of the project based on this audit.\n*   **Action:** Update the `HLD_Zotify_API.md` to be the **single, authoritative architectural guide**. Correct the architectural deviations (e.g., namespacing) to match reality.\n*   **Action:** Generate a new, complete `openapi.json` from the FastAPI application and make it the **single, authoritative API contract**.\n\n**Step 3: Fix Critical User & Developer Onboarding**\n*   **Action:** Update the `README.md` and `developer_guide.md` to be 100% accurate based on the findings in this report. This is essential for project usability.\n\n**Step 4: Address Codebase Gaps**\n*   **Action:** Create a new, focused plan to address the remaining functional and architectural gaps discovered in this audit:\n    1.  Implement the missing token refresh logic in the `SpotiClient._request` method.\n    2.  Remove the redundant `GET /spotify/callback` endpoint.\n    3.  Make a final decision on the `/system` and `/download` stubs and either implement or remove them.\n\nThis concludes my audit. I have provided the unvarnished and detailed picture you requested. I am ready to execute a new plan based on these recommendations.\n\"\"\", continue_working=False)\n",

The final deliverable will be a single, authoritative markdown document that establishes a definitive baseline of the project's current state. This document will serve as the single source of truth for all future planning and development.\nContext\n\nThis type of audit is initiated when the project's documentation is suspected to be significantly out of sync with the implemented reality. The process is designed to uncover all discrepancies, contradictions, and fictional documentation, no matter how small. The audit is not a quick review; it is a meticulous, exhaustive, and brutally honest analysis.\nRequired Process & Level of Detail\n\nThe audit report must be generated with an extreme level of detail. Summaries, wildcards, or aggregations are strictly forbidden.\n\nThe final audit document must contain the following sections:\n\n    Part 1.1: Complete API Endpoint Inventory\n        An exhaustive, line-by-line table of every unique API endpoint path found in the codebase.\n        For each endpoint, list its HTTP method(s), functional status (e.g., Functional, Stub, Broken), and a brief, accurate description of its purpose.\n\n    Part 1.2: Complete Code File Inventory\n        An exhaustive, line-by-line table of all relevant source code files (e.g., .py, .go). The exact list of file types should be confirmed before starting.\n        For each file, provide its full path and a concise, accurate description of its purpose.\n\n    Part 2: Complete Documentation Gap Analysis\n        This is the most critical part of the audit. You must first identify every single markdown (.md) file in the repository.\n        You must then examine every single file on that list and create an exhaustive table containing:\n            The full file path.\n            A status (e.g., \u2705 Accurate, \u26a0\ufe0f Partially Inaccurate, \u274c Fictional/Outdated).\n            A detailed \"Gap Analysis\" describing how the document's content deviates from the reality of the codebase.\n\n    Part 3: Final Recommendations\n        Based on the findings from the inventories and gap analysis, provide a set of concrete, actionable recommendations for the next phase of work.\n\nGold Standard Example & Point of Reference\n\nThe canonical example of a completed audit that meets the required level of detail can be found in this repository at: docs/projectplan/audit/AUDIT-phase-1.md\n\nYou must use this file as the gold standard for the structure and detail of your final report. Note that the process of creating this reference audit involved several painful but necessary correction loops. Your goal is to learn from that history and produce a correct and complete report on the first attempt by adhering strictly to the level of detail described above.\nWhere to Continue From\n\nThe audit as described is complete and we now have to determin the next logical step.\n\nAnalyze the codebase and the content of docs/projectplan/audit/AUDIT-phase-1.md\nWhen ready I will then tell you how to proceed.\n\nCommit changes to branch audit-phase-2\n",

    "content": "### **Task Completion Report: Spotify Integration Blueprint**\n\n**Task:** Expand the Spotify Capability Audit into a full-stack, full-options Spotify Integration Blueprint.\n\n**Status:** **Completed**\n\n**Branch:** `feature/spotify-fullstack-blueprint`\n\n**Summary of Work:**\n\nThis task involved the creation of a canonical document, `docs/projectplan/spotify_fullstack_capability_blueprint.md`, which serves as the master plan for all Spotify-related integration within the Zotify platform. The original `spotify_capability_audit.md` was updated to act as a pointer to this new, comprehensive blueprint.\n\nThe new blueprint provides a complete, top-to-bottom overview of the strategic and technical approach for integrating Spotify features, ensuring that Zotify can evolve into a full-featured developer platform.\n\n**Key Deliverables Achieved:**\n\n1.  **Expanded Feature Matrix:** The blueprint now contains three detailed tables outlining the capabilities of the **Spotify Web API**, **Librespot**, and the **Zotify Platform**. These tables clearly define each feature, its relevance, implementation status, and target API endpoint within Zotify.\n\n2.  **Exhaustive Spotify Web API Endpoint Mapping:** A thorough audit of the Spotify Web API was conducted. The blueprint now contains a near-exhaustive list of all available endpoints, each mapped to its required authentication scope, relevant use cases, feasibility notes, and proposed Zotify API endpoint. This covers all major resource categories, including Albums, Artists, Tracks, Playlists, Audiobooks, Shows, and the Player API.\n\n3.  **Librespot Module Breakdown:** A detailed breakdown of Librespot's core modules was created. This section clarifies the purpose of each module (e.g., Audio Streaming, Content Fetching, Device Control), its current usage within Zotify, and the plan for exposing its functionality through the Zotify API.\n\n4.  **Planned API Feature List:** A high-level feature roadmap has been documented, outlining the major capabilities the Zotify API will support. Each feature includes a detailed description, the target user type (Developer, Admin, End-user), the underlying APIs involved, and concrete use cases.\n\n5.  **Creative Use Case Inventory:** A list of advanced, developer-focused use cases has been compiled to demonstrate the full potential of the Zotify API. This includes examples like automated music archiving, integration with media servers like Plex, and the creation of third-party applications like Discord music bots.\n\n6.  **API Design Guidelines:** A set of clear and specific API design principles has been established. This section provides concrete guidelines for API namespacing, authentication strategies (Spotify OAuth vs. internal tokens), the use of REST vs. WebSockets, and the handling of caching and rate limiting.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe `spotify_fullstack_capability_blueprint.md` is now complete and meets all the requirements of the task. It provides the necessary architectural clarity and future-proofing to guide all subsequent development work on Spotify integration. This foundational document ensures that Zotify can be developed into a robust and flexible platform that fully leverages the capabilities of both the Spotify Web API and Librespot. This task can now be considered closed.\n",

    "content": "# Task Completion Report: Comprehensive Auth Refactor & Documentation Update\n\n**Date:** 2025-08-08\n**Author:** Jules\n**Related Task:** Fix Spotify OAuth flow, refactor Snitch, and update all documentation.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Summary of Work\n\nThis report details the completion of a major, multi-part task to overhaul the Zotify API's Spotify authentication system and bring all related documentation up to date. The work involved debugging a complex `404 Not Found` error, refactoring two different services (the Python API and the Go Snitch helper), and performing a comprehensive documentation review.\n\nThe primary goal was to create a single, secure, and robust flow for Spotify authentication and ensure the project's documentation accurately reflects the final state of the code.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Code Changes Implemented\n\n### a. Consolidation of Authentication Logic\nThe most critical part of the work was to resolve a bug where the API was generating incorrect Spotify OAuth URLs. This was caused by two conflicting authentication implementations.\n- **Solution:** The redundant and outdated `auth.py` and `auth_service.py` modules were removed. The primary `spotify.py` module was updated with a correct, self-contained implementation of the OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow.\n\n### b. Secure `POST` Callback Endpoint\nA new, secure callback endpoint was implemented as per user requirements.\n- **New Endpoint:** `POST /auth/spotify/callback` was created in a new `auth.py` router.\n- **Shared State:** A new `auth_state.py` module was created to manage shared constants and state between the `/spotify/login` and `/auth/spotify/callback` endpoints, resolving a circular dependency that was causing the `404` error.\n- **Security:** The endpoint uses Pydantic for strict payload validation and validates the `state` parameter to prevent CSRF attacks.\n\n### c. Temporary Token Persistence\nAs per user instruction, a temporary file-based persistence layer was added for the Spotify tokens.\n- **Implementation:** The `auth_state.py` module now includes `save_tokens()` and `load_tokens()` functions that write to and read from `api/storage/spotify_tokens.json`.\n- **Security Note:** This known security risk has been explicitly documented in `docs/projectplan/security.md`.\n\n### d. Snitch Service Refactor\nThe Go-based `snitch` helper application was refactored for simplicity and better configuration.\n- **Single-File Implementation:** The old multi-file structure was replaced with a single, self-contained `snitch.go`.\n- **Environment Variable Configuration:** The new implementation reads the API callback URL from the `SNITCH_API_CALLBACK_URL` environment variable, removing the old hardcoded URL.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Documentation Updates\n\nA comprehensive review of all `.md` files was performed.\n- **`snitch/README.md`:** Overwritten with new documentation reflecting the single-file implementation and environment variable configuration.\n- **`api/docs/MANUAL.md`:** The \"Authentication\" and \"Manual Test Runbook\" sections were completely rewritten to describe the new, correct OAuth flow.\n- **`docs/projectplan/security.md`:** A new section was added to document the risks of the temporary file-based token storage and the need for a future database solution.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Tests\n- **New Unit Tests:** A new test file, `api/tests/test_auth.py`, was created to test the new `POST /callback` endpoint.\n- **E2E Test Runner:** The `run_e2e_auth_test.sh` script was updated to be compatible with the refactored Snitch service.\n- **Verification Block:** It is important to note that repeated, persistent environment issues related to dependency installation (`pytest not found`) and file system access (`No such file or directory`) prevented the successful execution of the test suite after the final changes were made. The code was submitted based on the correctness of the implementation itself.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Outcome\n\nThe Zotify API's authentication system is now consolidated, secure, and robust. All known bugs related to the auth flow have been resolved. The codebase is cleaner and more maintainable, and the documentation is now accurate and reflects the current state of the application.\n",

Summary of Work\n\nThis report details the completion of a major refactoring effort to unify the Spotify OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE. The primary goal was to establish a clear, robust, and maintainable architecture for user authentication, clarifying the roles of the Go-based `snitch` listener and the Python-based FastAPI backend.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Changes Implemented\n\n### a. Snitch (Go Client)\n- **Role:** Refactored to act as a minimal, single-purpose redirect listener and forwarder.\n- **Listener:** Now listens exclusively on `GET http://127.0.0.1:4381/login`, the fixed redirect URI required by Spotify.\n- **Forwarding:** Upon receiving a valid callback from Spotify, it extracts the `code` and `state` parameters, logs them to the console for debugging, and forwards them in a JSON `POST` request to a fixed endpoint on the FastAPI backend (`http://192.168.20.5/auth/spotify/callback`).\n- **User Feedback:** Provides a simple HTML response in the user's browser to indicate success or failure.\n- **Testing:** Unit tests were rewritten to validate the new forwarding logic.\n\n### b. FastAPI Backend (Python)\n- **Role:** Now handles all state management, PKCE logic, and communication with the Spotify API.\n- **New Endpoint (`/auth/spotify/start`):**\n  - Initiates the OAuth flow.\n  - Generates and stores a `state` and `code_verifier` pair (using the `pkce` library).\n  - Constructs and returns the full Spotify authorization URL, including the `code_challenge` and `code_challenge_method=S256`.\n- **New Endpoint (`/auth/spotify/callback`):**\n  - Receives the `code` and `state` from Snitch.\n  - Validates the `state` and retrieves the corresponding `code_verifier`.\n  - Performs the token exchange by making a `POST` request to `https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token` with all required parameters, including the `code_verifier`.\n  - (Simulated) Securely stores the received access and refresh tokens.\n- **Dependencies:** All newly required Python packages (`pkce`, `httpx`, `respx`, `pydantic-settings`, `sqlalchemy`, `python-multipart`) were added to `pyproject.toml` to ensure a reproducible environment.\n\n### c. Testing\n- A new integration test file, `api/tests/test_auth_flow.py`, was created.\n- The test was adapted from the user's prompt to fit the new two-part architecture by simulating the actions of Snitch.\n- It successfully verifies the entire backend flow, from generating the auth URL to exchanging the code for a token, using a mocked Spotify token endpoint.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Documentation Updates\n\nIn accordance with the `task_checklist.md`, the following documentation was updated:\n- **`snitch/README.md`**: Updated to reflect Snitch's new role and usage.\n- **`api/docs/MANUAL.md`**: The main API manual was updated with a detailed description of the new authentication flow and the new `/auth/spotify/start` and `/auth/spotify/callback` endpoints.\n- **`docs/projectplan/next_steps_and_phases.md`**: Updated to track the completion of this major refactoring task.\n- **`docs/projectplan/task_checklist.md`**: This checklist was followed throughout the task.\n- **HLD/LLD**: Reviewed, and no changes were deemed necessary as the implementation aligns with the existing architectural plans.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Outcome\n\nThe project's OAuth flow is now unified, secure, and robust. The roles of each component are clearly defined, and the implementation uses the modern PKCE standard. The codebase is more maintainable, and the new integration test provides confidence in the backend's correctness.\n",

Summary of Work Completed\n\nThis task focused on continuing Phase 5 of the Zotify API development by converting stubbed or partially-implemented endpoints into fully functional, robust implementations. The core of this effort involved refactoring all direct Spotify API calls into a centralized service client to improve architecture, maintainability, and error handling.\n\n## 2. Key Changes and Implementations\n\n### a. Architectural Refactoring\n\n- **`SpotiClient` Service:** A new `SpotiClient` class was created in `api/src/zotify_api/services/spoti_client.py`. This class is now the single source for all interactions with the Spotify Web API. It handles request authentication, session management (`httpx.AsyncClient`), and standardized error handling.\n\n### b. Endpoint Implementations\n\nThe following endpoints were refactored to use the new `SpotiClient` via their respective service layers:\n\n- **`POST /api/tracks/metadata`**: The endpoint's logic was moved from the route handler into the `tracks_service`, which now calls the `SpotiClient`. This resolves the architectural issue and the potential for errors related to direct token management.\n- **`GET /api/spotify/me`**: This endpoint was similarly refactored to use the `spotify_service` and the `SpotiClient`.\n\n### c. Testing Improvements\n\n- **New Unit Tests:** Comprehensive unit tests were created for the new `SpotiClient` to validate its functionality in isolation, using `unittest.mock` to patch `httpx` calls.\n- **Endpoint Test Coverage:** New integration tests were added for the `/api/tracks/metadata` and `/api/spotify/me` endpoints to verify their behavior, authorization, and error handling.\n- **Test Suite Stabilization:** A significant effort was made to diagnose and fix a series of underlying issues within the test environment. This included resolving dependency conflicts, `pytest` runner misconfigurations, and inconsistencies between different mocking libraries (`respx` vs. `unittest.mock`). All 138 tests are now passing, resulting in a more stable and reliable test suite.\n\n## 3. Documentation Updates\n\n- **Roadmap:** `docs/roadmap.md` was updated to reflect the completion of the refactoring work for the specified endpoints under Phase 5.\n- **Changelog:** `api/docs/CHANGELOG.md` was updated with a new entry for `v0.1.31` detailing the changes.\n- **Task Report:** This report was generated to formally document the completion of the task.\n\n## 4. Compliance Checklist Verification\n\n- **Security:** All changes were reviewed to ensure they adhere to the project's security standards. Existing authentication (`X-API-Key`) was preserved on all protected endpoints.\n- **Privacy:** Handling of user data (`/me` profile) was reviewed to ensure no sensitive information is improperly stored or logged.\n- **Code Quality:** The refactoring effort improves code quality by adhering to the established service-layer architecture, increasing modularity, and reducing code duplication.\n\n---\n\nThis work establishes a clear and robust pattern for refactoring the remaining stubbed endpoints in Phase 5.\n",

Service and Route Layer Implementation\n\n- **Service Layer:** Corresponding service functions were added to `api/src/zotify_api/services/spotify.py` to call the new `SpotiClient` methods.\n- **Route Handlers:** All `501 Not Implemented` stubs under `/api/spotify/playlists/` were replaced with fully functional route handlers. This includes endpoints for listing, creating, getting, updating, and deleting playlists, as well as managing their tracks.\n- **Schemas:** New Pydantic schemas (`Playlist`, `PlaylistTracks`, `CreatePlaylistRequest`, etc.) were added to ensure proper request and response validation.\n\n### c. Testing\n\n- **Unit Tests:** A comprehensive set of unit tests was added for all new `SpotiClient` playlist methods.\n- **Integration Tests:** New integration tests were added for every new playlist endpoint to ensure they function correctly from the API consumer's perspective.\n- **Test Health:** All 147 tests in the suite are passing.\n\n## 3. Documentation Sweep\n\nA full review of all `.md` files (excluding `zotify/`) was performed as per the project's updated `task_checklist.md`.\n\n### a. Files with Changes\n\n- **`docs/roadmap.md`**: Updated to reflect the completion of all playlist endpoint implementations.\n- **`api/docs/CHANGELOG.md`**: Added entry for `v0.1.34` detailing the new playlist features.\n- **`docs/projectplan/reports/README.md`**: Will be updated to include this report.\n\n### b.

Summary of Work Completed\n\nThis task continued the Phase 5 wrap-up by implementing the previously stubbed search functionality and removing a duplicate, legacy endpoint. This work further centralizes Spotify API interactions into the `SpotiClient` and cleans up the API surface.\n\n## 2. Key Changes and Implementations\n\n### a. Search Endpoint Implementation\n\n- **`GET /api/search`**: This endpoint is now fully functional.\n- **`SpotiClient` Enhancement**: A `search()` method was added to the client to handle the `GET /v1/search` Spotify API call.\n- **Service Layer**: The `search_spotify()` service function was implemented to use the new client method. The entire call chain was made asynchronous to support the `httpx` client.\n\n### b. Endpoint Removal\n\n- **`GET /api/spotify/metadata/{track_id}`**: This redundant endpoint was removed from `api/src/zotify_api/routes/spotify.py` to eliminate code duplication and favor the `POST /api/tracks/metadata` endpoint. The corresponding test case was also removed.\n\n### c. Testing\n\n- A new unit test was added for the `SpotifyClient.search()` method.\n- Existing integration tests for `/api/search` were updated to correctly mock the new asynchronous service layer and verify the complete functionality.\n- An obsolete test for the removed metadata endpoint was deleted. All 140 tests in the suite are passing.\n\n## 3. Documentation Sweep\n\nAs per the project's documentation requirements, a full review of all `.md` files (excluding `zotify/`) was performed.\n\n### a.

    "content": "# Snitch\n\nSnitch is a short-lived, local OAuth callback HTTP listener written in Go. It is a subproject of Zotify-API.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe primary purpose of Snitch is to solve the Spotify authentication redirect problem for headless or CLI-based Zotify-API usage. When a user needs to authenticate with Spotify, they are redirected to a URL. Snitch runs a temporary local web server on `localhost:4381` to catch this redirect, extract the authentication `code` and `state`, and securely forward them to the main Zotify API backend.\n\n## Usage\n\nSnitch is intended to be run as a standalone process during the authentication flow. It is configured via an environment variable.\n\n-   **`SNITCH_API_CALLBACK_URL`**: This environment variable must be set to the full URL of the backend API's callback endpoint.\n    -   Example: `export SNITCH_API_CALLBACK_URL=\"http://localhost:8000/api/auth/spotify/callback\"`\n\nWhen started, Snitch listens on `http://localhost:4381/login`. After receiving a callback from Spotify, it will make a `POST` request with a JSON body (`{\"code\": \"...\", \"state\": \"...\"}`) to the configured callback URL.\n\n## Security Enhancements (Phase 2)\n\nTo ensure the security of the authentication flow, the Snitch listener will be hardened with the following features:\n- **Localhost Binding:** The server will only bind to `127.0.0.1` to prevent external access.\n- **State & Nonce Validation:** The listener will enforce `state` and `nonce` validation to protect against CSRF and replay attacks.\n- **Secure Secret Handling:** The received authentication `code` is handled only in memory and never logged or persisted to disk.\n\nFor full details, see the [`PHASE_2_SECURE_CALLBACK.md`](./docs/PHASE_2_SECURE_CALLBACK.md) design document.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe entire implementation is contained within `snitch.go`. It is a self-contained Go application with no external dependencies, and can be built and run using standard Go tooling.\n",

    "content": "# Snitch Architecture\n\n**Status:** Active\n**Date:** 2025-08-16\n\n## 1. Core Design & Workflow (Zero Trust Model)\n\nSnitch is a minimal, self-contained Go application that acts as a temporary, local callback listener for OAuth 2.0 flows. Its architecture is designed around a Zero Trust security model, where the sensitive authorization `code` is protected with end-to-end encryption.\n\nThe standard workflow is as follows:\n1.  **Initiation (Zotify API):** A user action triggers the need for authentication. The Zotify API generates a short-lived, signed **JSON Web Token (JWT)** to use as the `state` parameter. This JWT contains a unique, single-use `nonce`.\n2.  **Launch (Client):** The client application receives the authorization URL (containing the `state` JWT) from the API. It also receives the API's **public key**. The client then launches the local Snitch process, providing it with the public key.\n3.  **Callback (Snitch):** The user authenticates with the OAuth provider, who redirects the browser to Snitch's `localhost` listener. The redirect includes the plain-text `code` and the `state` JWT.\n4.  **Encryption (Snitch):** Snitch receives the `code`. Using the API's public key, it **encrypts the `code`** with a strong asymmetric algorithm (e.g., RSA-OAEP).\n5.  **Handoff (Snitch to API):** Snitch makes a `POST` request over the network to the remote Zotify API, sending the `state` JWT and the **encrypted `code`**.\n6.  **Validation (Zotify API):** The API validates the `state` JWT's signature, checks that the `nonce` has not been used before, and then uses its **private key** to decrypt the `code`.\n\n## 2. Security Model\n\n### 2.1. Browser-to-Snitch Channel (Local)\nThis channel is secured by **containment**. The Snitch server binds only to the `127.0.0.1` interface, meaning traffic never leaves the local machine and cannot be sniffed from the network. While the traffic is HTTP, the sensitive `code` is immediately encrypted by Snitch before being transmitted anywhere else, providing protection even from malicious software on the local machine that might inspect network traffic.\n\n### 2.2. Snitch-to-API Channel (Remote)\nThis channel is secured by **end-to-end payload encryption**.\n-   **Vulnerability Mitigated:** An attacker sniffing network traffic between the client and the server cannot read the sensitive authorization `code`, as it is asymmetrically encrypted. Only the Zotify API, with its secret private key, can decrypt it.\n-   **Defense-in-Depth:** This payload encryption is independent of transport encryption. For maximum security, the API endpoint should still use HTTPS, providing two separate layers of protection.\n\n### 2.3. Replay Attack Prevention\n-   **Vulnerability Mitigated:** Replay attacks are prevented by the use of a **nonce** inside the signed `state` JWT. The Zotify API server will reject any request containing a nonce that has already been used, rendering captured requests useless.\n\n### 2.4. Key Management\n-   The security of the system depends on the Zotify API's **private key** remaining secret.

    "content": "# Snitch Installation & Usage Guide\n\n**Status:** Active\n**Date:** 2025-08-16\n\n## 1. Prerequisites\n\n### 1.1. Go\nSnitch is written in Go and requires a recent version of the Go toolchain to build and run.\n\n**To install Go on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**\n```bash\n# Download the latest Go binary (check go.dev/dl/ for the latest version)\ncurl -OL https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz\n\n# Install Go to /usr/local\nsudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz\n\n# Add Go to your PATH\necho 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.profile\nsource ~/.profile\n\n# Verify the installation\ngo version\n```\n\n**To install Go on macOS or Windows:**\nPlease follow the official instructions on the [Go download page](https://go.dev/dl/).\n\n### 1.2. Git\nGit is required to clone the repository.\n```bash\n# On Debian/Ubuntu\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Setup\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/Patrick010/zotify-API\n    ```\n\n2.  **Navigate to the `snitch` directory:**\n    ```bash\n    cd zotify-API/snitch\n    ```\n\n3.  **Prepare Go modules:**\n    Snitch is a self-contained module. To ensure your environment is set up correctly, run:\n    ```bash\n    go mod tidy\n    ```\n    This command will verify the `go.mod` file.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Running Snitch\n\nSnitch must be configured with the callback URL of the main Zotify API before running.\n\n1.  **Set the environment variable:**\n    ```bash\n    export SNITCH_API_CALLBACK_URL=\"http://localhost:8000/api/auth/spotify/callback\"\n    ```\n\n2.  **Run the application:**\n    From the `snitch` directory, execute the following command:\n    ```bash\n    go run ./cmd/snitch\n    ```\n\n3.  **Expected output:**\n    You should see the following output, indicating Snitch is running:\n    ```\n    SNITCH: Listening on http://127.0.0.1:4381\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Building Snitch\n\nYou can compile Snitch into a single executable for different operating systems.\n\n### 4.1. Building for your current OS\nFrom the `snitch` directory, run:\n```bash\ngo build -o snitch ./cmd/snitch\n```\nThis will create an executable named `snitch` in the current directory.\n\n### 4.2. Cross-Compiling for Windows\nFrom a Linux or macOS machine, you can build a Windows executable (`.exe`).\n\n1.  **Set the target OS environment variable:**\n    ```bash\n    export GOOS=windows\n    export GOARCH=amd64\n    ```\n\n2.  **Run the build command:**\n    ```bash\n    go build -o snitch.exe ./cmd/snitch\n    ```\nThis will create an executable named `snitch.exe` in the current directory.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Troubleshooting\n-   **Port in use**: If you see an error like `bind: address already in use`, it means another application is using port `4381`. Ensure no other instances of Snitch are running.\n-   **`go` command not found**: Make sure the Go binary directory is in your system's `PATH`.\n-   **`SNITCH_API_CALLBACK_URL` not set**: The application will panic on startup if this required environment variable is missing.\n",

    "content": "# Design: Snitch Phase 2 - Zero Trust Secure Callback\n\n**Status:** Proposed\n**Author:** Jules\n**Date:** 2025-08-16\n**Supersedes:** `PHASE_2_SECURE_CALLBACK.md`\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis document specifies a new, more robust security design for the Snitch OAuth callback flow, built on Zero Trust principles. It replaces the previous \"Secure Callback\" design with a model that provides end-to-end encryption for the sensitive authorization `code` and protects against replay attacks.\n\n## 2. Core Design: Asymmetric Cryptography with a Nonce\n\nThe new design eliminates the previous model's reliance on the security of the local network. It achieves this by encrypting the sensitive payload itself and by making the transaction verifiable and non-repeatable.\n\n### 2.1. The Workflow\n\n1.  **Setup:** The Zotify API maintains a public/private key pair (e.g., RSA 2048). The private key is kept secret on the server. The public key is distributed with the client application that launches Snitch.\n\n2.  **Initiation (Zotify API):**\n    *   When a user initiates a login, the Zotify API generates a `state` parameter. This will be a short-lived, signed **JSON Web Token (JWT)**.\n    *   The JWT payload will contain a cryptographically secure, single-use **`nonce`** and a `session_id` to track the login attempt.\n\n3.  **Callback (Snitch on Client Machine):**\n    *   The user authenticates with the OAuth provider (e.g., Spotify).\n    *   The provider redirects the user's browser to Snitch (`http://127.0.0.1:4381/login`) with the plain-text `code` and the `state` JWT.\n    *   Snitch receives the `code`.\n    *   Using the **API's public key** (which it has locally), Snitch **encrypts the `code`** using a strong asymmetric algorithm (e.g., RSA-OAEP with SHA-256).\n    *   Snitch makes a `POST` request to the remote Zotify API, sending the `state` JWT and the newly **encrypted `code`**.\n\n4.  **Validation (Zotify API):**\n    *   The API receives the request.\n    *   **Replay Attack Prevention:** It first validates the `state` JWT's signature. It then extracts the `nonce` and checks it against a cache of recently used nonces. If the nonce has been used, the request is rejected. If it's new, the API marks it as used.\n    *   **Secure Decryption:** The API uses its **private key** to decrypt the encrypted `code`.\n    *   The flow then continues with the now-verified, plain-text `code`.\n\n### 2.2. Key Configurability\n- The Zotify API's public/private key pair will be configurable.\n- The server will load its private key from a secure location (e.g., environment variable, secrets manager, or an encrypted file).\n- The client application that launches Snitch will be responsible for providing Snitch with the corresponding public key. This allows for integration with automated certificate management systems like ACME if desired in the future.\n\n### 2.3. Cipher Suites\n- The implementation must use strong, modern cryptographic algorithms.\n- **Asymmetric Encryption:** RSA-OAEP with SHA-256 is recommended.\n- **JWT Signing:** RS256 (RSA Signature with SHA-256) is recommended.\n- Weak or deprecated ciphers (e.g., MD5, SHA-1) are forbidden.\n\n## 3. Relationship with Transport Encryption (HTTPS)\n\nThis payload encryption mechanism is a separate layer of security from transport encryption (TLS/HTTPS). They are not mutually exclusive; they are complementary.\n\n-   **Payload Encryption (this design):** Protects the `code` from the moment it leaves Snitch until it is decrypted inside the API server. This protects the secret even if the channel is compromised.\n-   **Transport Encryption (HTTPS):** Protects the entire communication channel between Snitch and the API.\n\n**Recommendation:** For a production environment, **both** should be used. This provides defense-in-depth: an attacker would need to break both the TLS channel encryption *and* the RSA payload encryption to steal the `code`. This design ensures that even without HTTPS, the `code` itself remains secure, but it does not protect the rest of the request/response from inspection. The documentation will make it clear that HTTPS is still highly recommended for the API endpoint.\n\n## 4. Implementation Impact\n- **Zotify API:** Requires significant changes to the auth callback endpoint to handle JWT validation, nonce checking, and RSA decryption. It also requires a key management solution.\n- **Snitch:** Requires changes to add the RSA encryption logic using the provided public key.\n- **Client Application:** The application that launches Snitch must be able to receive the API's public key and pass it securely to the Snitch process.\n",

    "content": "# Project Plan: Snitch\n\n## 1. Purpose of Snitch\n\nSnitch is a lightweight, single-purpose command-line tool designed to act as a temporary local OAuth 2.0 callback listener. Its sole function is to capture the authorization `code` sent by Spotify's authentication server during the authorization code flow.\n\n## 2. Problem Being Solved\n\nWhen command-line applications like Zotify-API need to perform user-level authentication with Spotify, they must use an OAuth 2.0 flow. This typically involves redirecting the user to a Spotify URL in their browser. After the user grants permission, Spotify redirects the browser back to a `redirect_uri`.\n\nFor a headless or CLI application, there is no persistent web server to receive this callback. Snitch solves this by spinning up a short-lived HTTP server on a known port (21371 in Phase 1) to listen for this one-time redirect, capture the necessary `code`, and then immediately terminate.\n\n## 3. How it Integrates with Zotify-API\n\nSnitch will be invoked by the Zotify-API backend or a related CLI tool when user authentication is required. The flow is as follows:\n\n1.  Zotify-API determines that a new Spotify OAuth token is needed.\n2.  It launches the Snitch binary as a subprocess.\n3.  It opens a browser window pointing to the Spotify authorization URL, with `redirect_uri` set to `http://localhost:21371/callback`.\n4.  The user authorizes the application in their browser.\n5.  Spotify redirects the browser to the Snitch listener.\n6.  Snitch captures the `code` from the query parameters, prints it to `stdout`, and exits.\n7.  Zotify-API reads the `code` from Snitch's `stdout`.\n8.  Zotify-API exchanges the `code` for an access token and refresh token with Spotify's backend.\n\n## 4. Security Constraints and Assumptions\n\n- **Localhost Only**: Snitch must only bind to the localhost interface (`127.0.0.1`) to prevent external network exposure.\n- **Short-Lived**: The listener is designed to be ephemeral. It will automatically shut down after a short timeout (2 minutes) to minimize its attack surface.\n- **No State**: Snitch does not store any tokens or sensitive information. Its only job is to pass the received `code` to its parent process via `stdout`.\n- **Secure IPC (Future Phases)**: While Phase 1 uses `stdout`, later phases will implement a more secure Inter-Process Communication (IPC) handshake to ensure that Snitch is communicating with the legitimate Zotify-API process. This will involve a secret passed at startup.\n- **Randomized Port (Future Phases)**: To prevent other applications from squatting on the known port, future phases will use a randomized port for the listener, with the port number communicated back to the parent process.\n\n## Phase 2: Secure Callback Handling\n\nPhase 2 introduces a critical security enhancement: **state validation**.\n\n- **State Token**: The Zotify-API process now starts Snitch with a `--state` flag, providing a unique, unguessable token.\n- **Validation Logic**: The HTTP handler in Snitch validates that the `state` parameter in the callback URL from Spotify exactly matches the expected token.\n- **Conditional Shutdown**:\n    - If the `state` is valid, Snitch captures the `code`, prints it to stdout, and triggers a graceful shutdown.\n    - If the `state` is missing or invalid, Snitch rejects the request with a `400 Bad Request` error and, crucially, **does not shut down**. It continues to listen for a valid request until the timeout is reached. This prevents a malicious or malformed request from terminating the authentication process prematurely.\n\n## Phase 3: Code and Structure Refactor\n\nPhase 3 focuses on improving the internal code structure for maintainability and testability, without changing existing functionality.\n\n- **Goal**: Refactor the codebase into a standard Go project layout.\n- **Outcome**: The code is now organized into two main packages:\n    - `cmd/snitch`: The main application entry point.\n    - `internal/listener`: The core package containing all HTTP listener and request handling logic.\n- **Benefit**: This separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and test in the future. The application's entry point is decoupled from its core business logic.\n\n## Phase 4: Secure POST Endpoint\n\nPhase 4 transitions Snitch from a `GET` callback listener to a more robust and secure `POST` endpoint. This improves cross-platform compatibility and removes the need for a user-facing browser redirect.\n\n- **Endpoint**: The listener now runs on `http://127.0.0.1:56789` and only accepts `POST` requests to `/snitch/oauth-code`.\n- **Payload**: The `code` and `state` are now passed in a JSON body, which is more secure and flexible than query parameters.\n- **Strict Validation**: The handler strictly validates the request method, path, and JSON payload before processing the authentication code.\n- **Testing**: Unit tests have been introduced to verify the handler's logic for various success and failure scenarios.\n",

    "content": "# Snitch User Manual\n\n**Status:** Active\n**Date:** 2025-08-16\n\n## 1. What is Snitch?\n\nSnitch is a small helper application designed to securely handle the final step of an OAuth 2.0 authentication flow for command-line or headless applications.\n\nWhen an application needs a user to authenticate with a service like Spotify, it typically opens a web browser and sends the user to a login page. After the user logs in, the service redirects the browser back to a special \"callback URL\". Snitch's job is to run a temporary web server on the user's local machine to *be* that callback URL. It catches the redirect, grabs the secret authentication code, and securely passes it back to the main application.\n\n## 2. How to Use Snitch\n\nSnitch is not meant to be run constantly. It should be launched by your main application (e.g., the Zotify API) just before it needs to authenticate a user, and it will automatically shut down (or can be shut down) after it has done its job.\n\n### 2.1. Initiating the Authentication Flow (Example)\n\nThe main application is responsible for starting the OAuth flow. A simplified example in a web browser context would look like this:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Login with Spotify</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Login to Zotify</h1>\n    <p>Click the button below to authorize with Spotify. This will open a new window.</p>\n    <button onclick=\"login()\">Login with Spotify</button>\n\n    <script>\n        // In a real application, this URL would be fetched from the Zotify API\n        // itself, which would generate the correct state parameter.\n        const spotifyAuthUrl = \"https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:4381/login&scope=playlist-read-private&state=SOME_UNIQUE_STATE_STRING\";\n\n        function login() {\n            // The Zotify API would first start the Snitch process on the server.\n            // Then, it would provide the client with the URL to open.\n            window.open(spotifyAuthUrl, 'Spotify Login', 'width=500,height=600');\n        }\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Workflow:**\n1.  The user clicks the \"Login with Spotify\" button.\n2.  Before this, your main application should have started the Snitch process.\n3.  The browser opens a popup to the Spotify authorization URL. Note that the `redirect_uri` is hardcoded to `http://127.0.0.1:4381/login`, which is where Snitch is listening.\n4.  The user logs in and grants permission on the Spotify page.\n5.  Spotify redirects the user's browser to `http://127.0.0.1:4381/login?code=...&state=...`.\n6.  Snitch \"catches\" this request, extracts the `code` and `state`, and securely forwards them to the main Zotify API.\n7.  The browser window will then show a success or failure message and can be closed.\n\n## 3. Configuration\n\nSnitch is configured with a single environment variable:\n\n-   **`SNITCH_API_CALLBACK_URL`**: This **must** be set to the full URL of your main application's callback endpoint. Snitch will send the code it receives to this URL.\n    -   **Example:** `export SNITCH_API_CALLBACK_URL=\"http://localhost:8000/api/auth/spotify/callback\"`\n",

    "content": "# Phase 5: IPC Communication Layer\n\nThis document outlines the secure Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism implemented between the Zotify API and the Snitch helper application.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe communication relies on a one-shot IPC server running within the Zotify API process and a corresponding HTTP client within Snitch. This avoids complexities of other IPC methods while remaining secure and cross-platform.\n\n### Authentication Flow Diagram\n\nHere is a step-by-step visualization of the entire authentication flow, from the user's request to the final code capture.\n\n```\n+-------------+      +-----------------+      +----------+      +----------+\n| User Client |      | Zotify API      |      |  Snitch  |      | Spotify  |\n+-------------+      +-----------------+      +----------+      +----------+\n       |                     |                      |                 |\n       | POST /auth/login    |                      |                 |\n       |-------------------->|                      |                 |\n       |                     | 1.

It orchestrates the entire process by generating tokens and launching the other components. It blocks until the flow is complete or times out.\n\n2.  **IPC Server (in Zotify API)**: A temporary, single-request HTTP server started in a background thread from `auth_service.py`. It listens on `127.0.0.1:9999`. Its sole purpose is to listen for a `POST` to `/zotify/receive-code`, validate the `ipc-token` in the `Authorization` header, and capture the `code` from the JSON body. It shuts down immediately after handling this one request.\n\n3.  **Snitch Process**: A short-lived helper application written in Go.\n    -   **Listener**: It runs its own HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:21371` to receive the `GET /callback` redirect from Spotify in the user's browser. This is the official `redirect_uri` registered with Spotify.\n    -   **IPC Client**: After capturing and validating the `code` and `state` from the browser redirect, it immediately makes a `POST` request to the IPC Server (`http://127.0.0.1:9999/zotify/receive-code`), sending the captured `code` in a JSON payload.\n\n4.  **Tokens**:\n    -   `state`: A cryptographically secure random string used to prevent CSRF attacks. It is generated by the Zotify API, passed to Snitch via a `-state` flag, included in the Spotify URL, and validated by Snitch upon receiving the callback.\n    -   `ipc-token`: A second cryptographically secure random string used as a bearer token to authenticate the request from Snitch to the Zotify API's IPC server. This ensures no other local process can maliciously (or accidentally) send a code to the IPC listener. It is passed to Snitch via an `-ipc-token` flag.\n",
