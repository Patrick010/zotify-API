# Documentation Maintenance Guide

This guide outlines the process for maintaining the project's documentation.

## General Principles

*   **Documentation-first:** Documentation should be updated before or alongside the code changes that it describes.
*   **Single source of truth:** The `docs/` directory is the single source of truth for all project documentation.
*   **Consistency:** All documentation should be written in a clear, concise, and consistent style.

## Before Closing a Task

Before closing a development task, you must ensure that all relevant documentation has been updated. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **HLD and LLD:** The High-Level Design and Low-Level Design documents must be updated to reflect any changes to the system's architecture or design.
*   **API Reference:** The API reference must be updated to reflect any changes to the API, including new endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.
*   **Developer Guide:** The developer guide must be updated to reflect any changes that affect how developers work with the system.
*   **Operator Guide:** The operator guide must be updated to reflect any changes that affect how operators manage the system.
*   **Security Documentation:** The security documentation must be updated to reflect any changes that affect the security of the system.
*   **Changelog:** The changelog must be updated with a clear and concise description of the changes.
*   **Task Execution Checklist:** You must review the [Task Execution Checklist](./task_checklist.md) and ensure that all applicable items have been addressed. Missing checklist items will prevent merge.
