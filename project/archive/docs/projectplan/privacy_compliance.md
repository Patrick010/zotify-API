# Privacy Compliance Overview

This document outlines how the Zotify API project complies with data protection laws, specifically the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## User Privacy Compliance Statement

Zotify respects user privacy and commits to protecting personal data by:

- Collecting only necessary data for functionality and services.
- Obtaining explicit user consent where required.
- Providing users with full access to their personal data, including export and deletion options.
- Ensuring data security through access control, encryption, and audit logging.
- Processing data transparently and lawfully, with clearly documented purposes.
- Supporting usersâ€™ rights to data correction, portability, and consent withdrawal.
- Conducting regular privacy impact assessments.

## API Compliance

- All API endpoints handling personal data enforce access controls and audit logging.
- Privacy by design and default are implemented in API logic and storage.
- Data minimization and retention policies are applied rigorously.
- Data export and deletion endpoints are provided under `/privacy/data`.

## Future Enhancements

- Implementation of role-based access control (RBAC) for fine-grained permissions.
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse of personal data endpoints.
- Continuous monitoring and improvements based on security reviews and audits.
