## 1. Purpose

This report identifies the current state of the Zotify API development relative to the strategic goals laid out in `spotify_fullstack_capability_blueprint.md`. It provides a gap matrix between what exists and what remains to be implemented, offers a roadmap alignment analysis, and introduces a continuation plan for execution. This report serves as an authoritative planning document and will be referenced by `next_steps_and_phases.md`.

## 5. Continuation Plan

### Immediate Next Steps

- [ ] Create and maintain `docs/projectplan/next_steps_and_phases.md`
  - **Source:** this report + `roadmap.md` + work in progress
  - **Ownership:** Jules
- [ ] Finalize remaining items from Phase 7:
  - Playlist modification endpoints
  - Library sync logic (API ‚Üî Zotify CLI)
  - Logging and revocation flows for Admin API key
- [ ] Automate Task Completion Reports
  - Hook into Jules flow (not per commit, per logical task)
  - Ensure all reports stored in `docs/projectplan/completions/`
- [ ] Track all gaps as GitHub Issues or Project board items
  - Reference sections from this report
