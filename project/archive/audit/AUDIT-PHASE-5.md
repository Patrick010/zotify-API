## AUDIT-010: Linter Overhaul and Documentation Process Refinement

**Date:** 2025-08-31
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To overhaul the documentation process and enhance the linter to enforce new, more rigorous documentation standards based on user feedback.

### Outcome
- **File Naming Convention Enforced:** All documentation files were renamed to follow the `UPPERCASE.extension` or `UPPERCASE.py.md` convention.
- **Master Index Created:** A new `api/docs/reference/MASTER_INDEX.md` was created to serve as a central registry for all API documentation.
- **Policy Updated:** The `AGENTS.md` file was updated to reflect the new, detailed workflow for developers, including the requirement to register new files in multiple locations.
- **Linter Overhauled:** The `scripts/lint-docs.py` script was rewritten to be fully convention-based. It now enforces that changes to source code are accompanied by changes to their corresponding documentation files, and that new files are correctly registered in the quality index.
- **Project Logs Updated:** All relevant project log files were updated to reflect the completion of this work.

## AUDIT-009: Automated Documentation Workflow

**Date:** 2025-08-29
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective Implement Automated Documentation Workflow Tooling

*   **Reason & Goal:** To fulfill the requirements of Audit Phase 5 by implementing the "Advanced Conditional Documentation Linter" and its associated tooling, as outlined in the `project/reports/HANDOVER_BRIEF_JULES.md` and `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md`. The goal is to create a robust, automated system for enforcing the project's "Living Documentation" policy.
*   **Status:** ✅ Done
*   **Summary of Activities:**
    1.  **File Operations:** Performed all required file setup, including renaming `scripts/roadmap-test.sh` to `scripts/run_lint.sh`, moving `project/lint-rules.yml` to `scripts/doc-lint-rules.yml`, and creating placeholder `mkdocs.yml` and `scripts/log-work.py` files.
    2.  **Dependency Management:** Added `mkdocs`, `mkdocs-material`, and `pydoc-markdown` to the development dependencies in `api/pyproject.toml` and installed them.
    3.  **Startup Script Updated:** Modified `scripts/start.sh` to launch the `mkdocs serve` documentation server in the background for developers.
    4.  **`log-work.py` Implemented:** Implemented the full logic for the `scripts/log-work.py` tool, which automates the updating of the three "Trinity" log files (`ACTIVITY.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`).
    5.  **`lint-docs.py` Enhanced:** Significantly enhanced the `scripts/lint-docs.py` script.
        - Corrected the path to the rules file.
        - **Added a new `forbidden_docs` feature** based on user feedback, allowing rules to prevent changes to certain files (e.g., point-in-time reports).
        - Refactored the script for better clarity and maintainability.
    6.  **Linter Rules Corrected:** Updated `scripts/doc-lint-rules.yml` with a comprehensive set of initial rules. Corrected a flawed rule regarding the `project/reports/HANDOVER_BRIEF_JULES.md` to use the new `forbidden_docs` feature, correctly classifying it as a static document.
    7.  **Verification:**
        - Fixed multiple issues in the test environment (`APP_ENV` not set, missing `storage` directory) to get the `pytest` suite (`run_lint.sh`) to pass.
        - Ran `mkdocs build` successfully after populating `mkdocs.yml` with a valid configuration.

### Outcome:
- ** All tooling and configuration for the new automated documentation workflow has been implemented. The project now has a powerful, configurable system for ensuring documentation quality and consistency.

## AUDIT-008: Comprehensive Repository Refactoring and QA Enhancement

**Date:** 2025-08-28
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To perform a wide-ranging series of tasks to improve the project's organization, documentation, and quality assurance framework. This session addressed significant repository clutter and established new, sustainable processes for tracking and improving code quality.

### Outcome
- **Repository Organized:** Addressed significant repository clutter by moving 8 utility scripts into `scripts/`, relocating `DEPENDENCIES.md`, and deleting 5 obsolete files. All internal script paths and project documentation were updated to reflect these changes.
- **Code Quality Framework Established:** A new Code Quality Index system was implemented across all three modules (`api`, `snitch`, `Gonk/GonkUI`), each with its own tracking file. A two-column scoring rubric was defined and documented in the developer guides.
- **Baseline Quality Assessment:** A baseline quality assessment was performed on the majority of source files across the project.
- **"Gold Standard" Documentation:** A comprehensive documentation file for `tracks_service.py` was created to serve as a high-quality example, and its score was updated in the index.
- **Process Hardening:** The project's `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` was updated to include a formal "Code QA" step in every phase, and the documentation linter was made more robust.
- **Conclusion:** The project is now in a significantly more organized and maintainable state, with a clear framework for ongoing quality improvement.

## AUDIT-007: Refine Quality Metrics and Document `tracks_service`

**Date:** 2025-08-28
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To refine the newly implemented Code Quality Index based on user feedback, separating the scoring into "Documentation" and "Code" metrics. This task also includes creating the first piece of detailed source code documentation to demonstrate the process and achieve an 'A' score for a critical file.

### Outcome
- **Quality Rubric Refined:** The scoring rubric was updated in all `CODE_QUALITY_INDEX.md` files and the `API_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` to have separate, clearly defined criteria for Documentation Score and Code Score.
- **`tracks_service.py` Documentation Created:** A comprehensive, standalone documentation file was created for the `tracks_service.py` module, detailing its purpose, functions, and usage.
- **Code Quality Assessed:** A code quality assessment was performed on `tracks_service.py`, resulting in a 'B' score.
- **Index Updated:** The API's `CODE_QUALITY_INDEX.md` was updated with the new 'A' (Doc) and 'B' (Code) scores for `tracks_service.py`, including detailed notes and a link to the new documentation.
- **Conclusion:** The quality tracking system is now more nuanced, and the process for improving a file's quality score has been successfully demonstrated.

## AUDIT-006: Code Quality and Repository Cleanup Initiative

**Date:** 2025-08-28
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Assignee:** Jules

### Objective
To address user feedback regarding repository organization and to proactively establish a system for tracking code quality. This session evolved from a single feature implementation into a broader initiative covering repository cleanup, process formalization, and tooling improvements.

### Outcome
- **Repository Organized:** Addressed repository clutter by moving 8 utility scripts into the `scripts/` directory, relocating `DEPENDENCIES.md` to `project/`, and deleting 5 obsolete files. The `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` was updated to reflect all changes.
- **Code Quality Index Established:** Created a new `CODE_QUALITY_INDEX.md` to serve as a registry for the quality status of all API source files. Performed a baseline assessment on key files and updated the `API_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` to incorporate this new process.
- **Doc Linter Hardened:** The `scripts/lint-docs.py` script was refactored to use an external `project/lint-rules.yml` configuration and was made more robust to prevent silent failures in faulty `git` environments.
- **Execution Plan Formalized:** The `project/EXECUTION_PLAN.md` was updated to include a "Code QA" step at the end of every project phase, ensuring a consistent quality gate.
- **Conclusion:** The project is now significantly more organized, and new processes are in place to track and encourage high code quality.

### Outcome
- **Documentation Refactored:** The `CODE_OPTIMIZATIONPLAN_PHASE_4.md` was restructured for better logical flow.
- **Process Clarified:** The `TASK_CHECKLIST.md` was updated with a new section describing the process for using the Code Review Scoring Rubric.
- **Future Work Prioritized:** The "Advanced Conditional Documentation Linter" was moved from `FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md` to the active task list for Phase 5 in `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md`.
- **Final Logs Updated:** All Trinity log files were updated to reflect the completion of the audit.
- **Conclusion:** The project audit is complete. The project is stable, well-documented, and ready for the next phase of development.
