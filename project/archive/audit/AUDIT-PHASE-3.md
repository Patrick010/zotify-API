## Task: Complete Phase 3 (Implementation & Alignment)

**Date:** 2025-08-20
**Status:** ✅ Done

### Objective
To formally close out Phase 3 of the HLD/LLD Alignment Plan by verifying that all active tasks in the traceability matrix are complete.

### Outcome
- A final review of the `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` confirmed that all features marked as `Exists? = N` were correctly deferred and tracked in `FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`.
- The `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md` was updated to mark Phase 3 as "Done".
- A concluding note was added to the traceability matrix.

## Task: Increase Test Coverage to >90% and Add CI Gate

**Date:** 2025-08-20
**Status:** ✅ Done

### Objective
To increase the test coverage of the API to over 90% and to implement a CI workflow that gates future pull requests on a minimum test coverage percentage.

### Outcome
- Test coverage was successfully increased from 83% to **90.01%**.
- Over 60 new unit tests were added to cover previously under-tested modules.
- A new GitHub Actions workflow was created at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to enforce a test coverage minimum of 85%.
- Several latent bugs in the test suite and application code were discovered and fixed.

## Task: Align Deferred Features in Traceability Matrix

**Date:** 2025-08-20
**Status:** ✅ Done

### Objective
To correctly align all deferred features (`JWT for API Authentication`, `Security Enhancements`, etc.) in the `AUDIT_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`.

### Outcome
- The traceability matrix was updated for all deferred features to `Exists? = N`, `Matches Design? = Y (Deferred)`.
- The `FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md` document was updated to ensure all these deferred features are explicitly tracked.

## Task: Clarify and Formalize Phase 3 Process

**Date:** 2025-08-19
**Status:** ✅ Done

### Objective
To improve the project's process documentation to clarify the goal and workflow of "Phase 3".

### Outcome
- The `HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md` was updated to rename Phase 3 to "Implementation & Alignment" and to provide a clear, algorithmic workflow for handling gaps.
- The `TASK_CHECKLIST.md` and `ONBOARDING.md` were updated to reinforce core development processes.

**Note:** Phase 3 is now closed. Phase 4 (Enforce & Automate) has started.
