# Proposal: Refactor and Strengthen Governance Audit System

**Author:** Jules
**Date:** 2025-09-27
**Status:** Approved

## 1. Abstract

This document proposes a comprehensive refactoring of the repository's governance audit script (`scripts/repo_inventory_and_governance.py`). The goal is to elevate the script from a basic inventory tool into a complete, automated audit system that enforces the project's "Living Documentation" policy with greater precision.

## 2. Objectives

The refactoring will focus on the following key enhancements:

1.  **Consolidate Code Indexing:** All code, script, and configuration files (`.py`, `.go`, `.sh`, `.yml`, `.json`) will be tracked against a single, unified index: `api/docs/CODE_FILE_INDEX.md`.
2.  **Implement Precise File-Type Mapping:** The script will adopt a new, stricter `FILETYPE_MAP` to correctly classify all files in the repository.
3.  **Detect Placeholder and Stub Files:** New logic will be added to identify and flag incomplete or placeholder files based on size, content keywords (e.g., "TODO"), and code structure.
4.  **Generate Enhanced Audit Report:** The script will produce a detailed, human-readable audit report at `project/reports/GOVERNANCE_AUDIT_REPORT.md`, including summary statistics and clear status indicators for every file (e.g., "OK," "missing index," "miscategorized," "stub").
5.  **Demonstrate Functionality:** A formal demonstration will be conducted and documented to verify the new system's effectiveness.

## 3. Justification

This refactor is the next logical step in the project's development, as outlined in the `project/reports/HANDOVER_BRIEF_JULES.md`. It will provide a robust, reliable, and fully automated mechanism for ensuring that all repository assets are correctly documented and tracked, significantly improving project governance and maintainability.

## 4. Deliverables

*   Updated `scripts/repo_inventory_and_governance.py` script.
*   Generated audit report at `project/reports/GOVERNANCE_AUDIT_REPORT.md`.
*   Demonstration report at `project/reports/GOVERNANCE_DEMO_REPORT.md`.
