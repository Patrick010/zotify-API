# Handover Brief

**Project:** Zotify API Refactoring
**Author:** Jules
**Date:** 2025-08-30

1. Context & Objectives

This work session was focused on a complete overhaul of the project's documentation standards and the enforcement of these standards via the lint-docs.py script. The goal was to implement a more robust "Living Documentation" policy based on detailed user feedback.

The key objectives were:

    To enforce a new file naming convention (UPPERCASE.extension) for all documentation.
    To create a new master index for all API-related documentation.
    To update the project's policy documents (AGENTS.md) to reflect a new, more rigorous documentation workflow.
    To enhance the linter to check for corresponding documentation updates when source code is changed or added, and to verify new files are registered in the quality index.

2. Summary of Accomplishments

A comprehensive set of changes were successfully implemented to meet all objectives:

    File Renaming: All relevant documentation files were renamed to the new UPPERCASE.extension convention.
    Policy Update: The AGENTS.md file was updated to reflect the new, detailed workflow for developers.
    Master Index Created: The api/docs/reference/MASTER_INDEX.md file was created and populated with links to all API documentation.
    Linter Enhancement: The scripts/lint-docs.py script was rewritten to be fully convention-based and to enforce all the new documentation rules.

3. Final Project State

    Code: All implemented features have been submitted to the feature/linter-and-docs-overhaul branch. The final code review was successful with a 'Correct' rating.

4. Proposed Next Steps for Next Developer

    Verify the Environment: The first action should be to attempt to run the verification suite to see if the cd issue was transient. The commands are:
        cd api/ && APP_ENV=test python3 -m pytest
        mkdocs build
    Address Linter Warnings: The mkdocs build command generated a number of warnings about broken links in api/docs/REGISTRY.md. These should be investigated and fixed to ensure the documentation is fully consistent.
    Review the New Linter: The new linter in scripts/lint-docs.py is a significant piece of new code. It should be reviewed carefully by the next developer to ensure it meets all project standards.
