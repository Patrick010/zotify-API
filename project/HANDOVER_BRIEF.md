# Handover Brief

**Project:** Zotify API Refactoring 
**Author:** Jules

1. Executive Summary

We are currently in the last phase 5 of an audit and are executing the recommendations from project/audit/HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md.
This session successfully completed a major documentation overhaul. The primary goals were to address a large backlog of documentation debt by cleaning up the project archive, consolidating valuable information, and establishing clear, actionable project plans for key modules. The project is now in a clean, stable, and well-documented state, ready for the next phase of work.

2. Work Completed in Final Commit

The final commit (feat(docs): Clean archive, create Snitch plan, and update logs) includes the following key achievements:

    Archive Cleanup: Over 20 obsolete, inaccurate, or superseded documents were deleted from the project/archive/ directory, significantly reducing project clutter.
    Documentation Consolidation: Valuable historical context and security warnings were migrated from archived files into the current, live documentation (CHANGELOG.md, SYSTEM_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md, SECURITY.md).
    GDPR Feature Design: A feature gap for GDPR compliance was addressed by formally designing the /privacy/data endpoints in the HLD/LLD and adding the implementation task to the backlog.
    Snitch Module Plan: A new, comprehensive project plan was created for the Snitch module at snitch/docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md and was integrated into the main PID and Project Registry.
    Process Improvements: The AGENTS.md file was updated to clarify the manual logging process, and all project logs were updated to reflect the completed work.

3. Current System Status

    The Codebase is Stable: The underlying application code is stable and all tests pass.
    The Git State is Clean: The audit-phase-5g branch contains all the work described above in a single, comprehensive commit.
    Known Issues: The notifications endpoints are known to be unauthenticated, as documented in project/SECURITY.md. This should be addressed in a future development cycle.

4. Recommended Next Steps

The next developer should start a new task on a new branch audit-phase-5h.

The immediate next task after reading AGENTS.md and the complete project documentation set is to begin working through the "Loose Ends Backlog".

    Create the Backlog File: Create a new file at project/LOOSE_ENDS_BACKLOG.md using the content provided below.
    Execute the Backlog: Systematically work through the "Open Items" listed within that file, creating separate, atomic commits for each resolved item as instructed in the file's "Meta" section. The first item to address will be the "Gap Analysis Framework".

This will continue the process of improving the project's documentation and process maturity.

Task: 

1. Add this file under project/LOOSE_ENDS_BACKLOG.md:

# Loose Ends Backlog

This document tracks design and documentation tasks that were discussed but never fully integrated into the repository.  
Each item should be reviewed, documented, and closed out systematically.

---

## Done
1. **Code & Documentation Quality Ratings**
   - Status: **Done**
   - Integrated into repo docs (A/B/C rubric with objective + human criteria).
   - No further action needed.

2. **Snitch Integration (Base)**
   - Status: **Done (basic version exists)**

---

## Open Items

### 2. Gap Analysis Framework (Template + Skeleton)
- **Problem**: We drafted a combined skeleton+template form for gap analysis, so devs can be tasked with "Run a gap analysis and solve it. Use this form."  
- **Status**: Not in repo. Lives only in chat notes.  
- **Action**: Move into `project/process/GAP_ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE.md` so devs know exactly how to execute.  

---

### 3. Snitch OAuth Helper (Security Improvements)
- **Problem**: Current Snitch is basic. Browser ↔ helper comms are vulnerable to replay/sniffing attacks.  
- **Action**: Update `snitch/PROJECT_PLAN.md` including:  
  - **Goals**: Secure OAuth callback transport (ephemeral, authenticated, replay-resistant).  
  - **Milestones**:  
    1. Define secure comms mechanism (e.g. HMAC token exchange or mutual auth).  
    2. Implement replay protection + TLS support.  
    3. Add automated integration test with Zotify-API.  
    4. Document usage in `snitch/README.md`.  
  - **Roadmap**: Link into `roadmap.md` Phase 7 or next open milestone.  

---

### 4. Roadmap File (Outdated)
- **Problem**: `roadmap.md` exists but content is outdated vs. actual phase progress.  
- **Action**:  
  - Compare `roadmap.md` with Next Steps/Phase Sequencing doc.  
  - Rewrite `roadmap.md` to reflect current state (Phase 3 wrap-up, Phase 4 approval, Phase 6–7 work planned).  
  - Add pointers to loose ends tracked here.  

---

### 5. Privacy Compliance Documentation
- **Problem**: `PRIVACY_COMPLIANCE.md` exists but is sparse. Endpoints like `/privacy/data` were added, but not fully documented.  
- **Action**:  
  - Flesh out compliance doc: list implemented endpoints, describe data handling flow, add operator instructions.  
  - Ensure `API Reference.md` reflects compliance endpoints.  
  - Cross-link from `SECURITY_GUIDE.md` and `OPERATOR_GUIDE.md`.  

---

## Meta
- This file (`LOOSE_ENDS_BACKLOG.md`) is temporary.  
- Once each item is resolved, it should be removed and archived in `project/archive/` and marked fully **Done**.
