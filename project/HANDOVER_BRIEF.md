Handover Brief: User Registration Feature Complete

Context: This document describes the project state immediately following the implementation of the user registration feature for the GonkUI test application. The goal was to allow developers to create new local users directly from the UI to facilitate JWT testing. All work is on the api-phase-4a branch.
1. Summary of Completed Work

A complete user registration workflow has been added to the GonkUI. This feature complements the existing login functionality and allows for end-to-end testing of the local JWT authentication system.

    Frontend: A "Register" panel with a form for a username and password was added to the main UI (index.html). JavaScript logic was implemented in app.js to send the registration data to the GonkUI backend and display status messages.
    Backend: A new /jwt/register endpoint was added to the GonkUI's Flask backend (jwt_ui.py). This endpoint receives the request from the frontend.
    API Client: The internal JWTClient was updated with a register() method that makes the final POST request to the main Zotify API's /api/auth/register endpoint.

2. System State at Time of Handover

    GonkUI Functionality: The GonkUI can now be used to both register new local users and log in with them to obtain a JWT. This makes it a much more self-contained tool for testing user-specific API endpoints.
    Codebase: The changes are confined to the GonkUI application (Gonk/GonkUI/). The main API, project documentation, and developer scripts have not yet been modified.
    Known Issues:
        The passlib/bcrypt dependency conflict still exists in the main API.
        The developer workflow for running the GonkUI testing application is not streamlined.
        The new registration feature is not yet documented.

3. Recommended Next Steps

Based on the completion of this feature, the following actions are recommended:

    Documentation: The Gonk/GonkUI/docs/USER_MANUAL.md should be updated immediately to include instructions on how to use the new registration panel.
