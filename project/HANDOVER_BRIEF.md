# Handover Brief

**Project:** Zotify API Refactoring

1. Context & Accomplishments

This handover follows a series of major updates to the project's linter and governance framework. The state of the repository includes the following significant changes:

    Linter Enhancements: The core linter script (scripts/linter.py) has been significantly improved.
        A critical bug that caused crashes on renamed files has been fixed.
        The deprecated --run-all flag has been removed.
        A --test-files argument has been added to allow for testing the linter's logic without a git environment, which was necessary to overcome sandbox limitations.

    Code Quality Index Overhaul:
        The three separate CODE_QUALITY_INDEX.md files have been consolidated into a single, canonical file at api/docs/CODE_QUALITY_INDEX.md.
        This new index file has been updated with a full A-F scoring rubric legend.
        All modules have been critically re-assessed against this stricter A-F scale, providing a more honest and accurate view of the project's technical debt. The table formats have also been made uniform.

    Expanded Linter Enforcement:
        The linter's rule set (scripts/doc-lint-rules.yml) has been expanded to enforce the maintenance of all key project indexes (MASTER_INDEX.md, CODE_QUALITY_INDEX.md, PROJECT_REGISTRY.md).
        A new linter function was added to validate that all scores in the quality index conform to the A-F standard.

    Documentation Alignment: All key governance documents (AGENTS.md, QA_GOVERNANCE.md, API_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) have been updated to reflect the new linter capabilities and documentation structure.

2. Unfinished Task: Enforce Mandatory Logging

The immediate next task is to enforce the project rule that logs must be updated in every commit.

    Objective: Modify the linter so that it fails if the three main log files (ACTIVITY.md, SESSION_LOG.md, CURRENT_STATE.md) are not part of the changed files in a commit.
    Proposed Solution:
        Add a new, unconditional rule to scripts/doc-lint-rules.yml.
        Modify the check_doc_matrix_rules function in scripts/linter.py to handle unconditional rules (rules with no source_paths).
        Update AGENTS.md to remove the instruction about manual logging.

4. Recommended Next Steps for You

    Implement the "Enforce Mandatory Logging" task as a new, focused feature. The proposed solution above should be a good guide.
    Submit your work as a new, atomic pull request.

The codebase is in a stable and much-improved state. This final logging enforcement task is the last piece of the puzzle for this phase of governance hardening.
