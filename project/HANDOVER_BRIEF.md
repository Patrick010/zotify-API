Handover Brief: GonkUI Developer Experience Enhancements Complete

1. Context

This document describes the project state following a series of updates focused on improving the developer experience and functionality of the GonkUI testing tool. These changes have made the tool more robust, easier to manage, and more flexible for testing against different API backends.

2. Summary of Completed Work

    GonkUI Management Script (scripts/gonkui):
        A new standalone Python script was created to manage the GonkUI lifecycle.
        It supports starting the server in the foreground with live logging and developer auto-reload (--start).
        It supports gracefully stopping the server (--stop) using PID file management.
        The script defaults to listening on 0.0.0.0 for broader network access during development.
        Detailed usage instructions were added to the Gonk/GonkUI/docs/USER_MANUAL.md.

    Configurable API Backend URL:
        The GonkUI frontend has been enhanced with a new input field in the header, allowing the target Zotify API URL to be set directly from the UI.
        This setting is now persisted in the browser's localStorage, removing the need to configure it via environment variables for a smoother workflow.

    Documentation and Dependency Fixes:
        The Gonk/GonkUI/README.md file was refactored to serve as a high-level overview, directing users to the user manual for detailed setup instructions.
        Underlying bugs in Gonk/GonkUI/app.py were fixed to ensure compatibility with the flask run command used by the new management script.
        The requests and watchdog packages were added as explicit dependencies to Gonk/GonkUI/pyproject.toml to ensure reliable operation of the application and its auto-reload feature.

3. System State at Time of Handover

    Functionality: The GonkUI application is fully functional and significantly more robust for development and testing purposes.
    Known Issues:
        passlib/bcrypt Conflict: The dependency conflict in the main API, noted in the previous handover, has not been addressed and possibly 

4. Recommended Next Steps

The immediate next step is to perform the large-scale documentation update that was recently requested. This involves:

    Updating the project/EXECUTION_PLAN.md to retroactively document the completion of Phases 3, 4, and 5.
    Updating the api/docs/manuals/USER_MANUAL.md with a comprehensive list of current user capabilities.
    Updating the api/docs/MASTER_INDEX.md with a new top-level summary.

Ask the user for a full task description.
