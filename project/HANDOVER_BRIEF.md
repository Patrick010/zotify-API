# Handover Brief - 2025-09-20

## 1. Project Goal

The primary goal of this work session was to implement Phase 3a and 3b of the project roadmap. This included:
-   Implementing a full JWT-based authentication system.
-   Refactoring the `gonk-testUI` project into a `Gonk` project with two sub-projects: `GonkUI` (a web UI for testing) and `GonkCLI` (a command-line tool).
-   Implementing a new `notifications_enabled` user preference, including a database migration.

## 2. Current Status

The implementation of all the above features is complete. However, the development process was hindered by several environment and dependency issues that blocked the API server and the GonkUI application from running.

The main focus of the latter part of the session was to diagnose and fix these blocking issues.

## 3. Recent Fixes

The following critical issues have been addressed:

-   **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'jose'`**: Fixed by adding the `python-jose[cryptography]` dependency to `api/pyproject.toml`.
-   **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'passlib'`**: Fixed by adding the `passlib[bcrypt]` dependency to `api/pyproject.toml`.
-   **`sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file`**: Fixed by adding code to `api/src/zotify_api/main.py` to create the `api/storage` directory on application startup.
-   **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Gonk'`**: Fixed by correcting the Python path for the Gonk project. This involved adding a `Gonk/pyproject.toml` file for `pytest` and modifying `Gonk/GonkUI/app.py` to add the project root to `sys.path` at runtime.

## 4. Outstanding Issues & Next Steps

The immediate next step is to verify that the recent fixes have resolved the startup issues for both the Zotify API and the GonkUI application.

**Next Steps for the Next Developer:**

1.  **Install Dependencies**: Make sure to install the newly added dependencies by running `pip install -e .` in the `api/` directory (for `python-jose` and `passlib`) and `pip install -e .` in the `Gonk/GonkUI` directory.
2.  **Run the Zotify API Server**:
    ```bash
    cd api
    PYTHONPATH=./src uvicorn zotify_api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
    ```
    Verify that the server starts without any errors.

3.  **Run the GonkUI Server**:
    ```bash
    cd Gonk/GonkUI
    python3 app.py
    ```
    Verify that the UI application starts and is accessible in the browser.

4.  **Final Validation**: Once the applications are running, perform a full manual validation of the GonkUI's JWT panel functionality against the checklist provided by the user in the task description.

5.  **Submit**: If all validation passes, the work can be considered complete and ready for final submission.
