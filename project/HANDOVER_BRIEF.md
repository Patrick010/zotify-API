# Handover Brief

**Project:** Zotify API Refactoring 
**Author:** Jules 
**Date:** 2025-08-31 

1. Executive Summary

This handover marks the completion of a significant documentation and process initiative: the establishment of a canonical baseline for the API's endpoints. A new system is now in place (endpoints.yaml) to track the status of all endpoints (planned vs. implemented), which will bring much-needed clarity to the development roadmap.

However, it is critical to note that this work was performed on a codebase that contains several significant, unresolved bugs and inconsistencies. The immediate priority for the next developer will be to stabilize the system by addressing a critical database error and fixing the broken test suite before proceeding with new feature development.
2. Key Accomplishments

The primary deliverable of this work phase was the API Endpoint Baseline System:

    Authoritative Baseline (api/docs/endpoints.yaml): A new YAML file has been created to serve as the single source of truth for all API endpoints. It tracks each endpoint's path, methods, and implementation status (planned, implemented, etc.).
    LLD Integration: A human-readable markdown table summarizing this baseline has been embedded in the project/LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN.md for easy reference during design discussions.
    Planning Integration: The EXECUTION_PLAN.md and ROADMAP.md have been updated to incorporate this new baseline into the project's planning and development process. The next phase of work is now explicitly defined as implementing the remaining planned endpoints.
    API Reference Update: The auto-generated API_REFERENCE.md has been updated with a note clarifying that it only shows implemented endpoints and points to the new YAML file for the complete picture.

3. Current System Status & Known Issues

    Critical Database Bug: The API is partially non-functional due to a database schema mismatch. The tracks_service.py attempts to query for artist and album columns that do not exist in the tracks table, causing a sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError whenever the /api/tracks endpoint is hit.
    /version Endpoint Failure: The /version endpoint is consistently failing with a TypeError due to an incorrect uptime calculation involving timezone-naive and timezone-aware datetime objects.
    Broken Functional Tests: The primary functional test suite (scripts/functional_test.py) is completely broken and fails with multiple 404 Not Found errors. The tests are out of sync with the actual API routes.
    Repository Clutter: The api/ directory contains at least 9 leftover, redundant, or temporary scripts (e.g., test_api.sh, route_audit.py) that need to be audited and removed.
    Latent CI Bug: The bandit.yml security configuration file is located in api/, but the CI workflow in .github/workflows/ci.yml expects it to be in the repository root. This may cause the CI security scan to fail or run with a default configuration.

4. Recommended Next Steps

The following tasks should be addressed in order of priority to stabilize the project:

    Fix Critical Bugs (High Priority):
        Resolve the database schema mismatch. The recommended approach is to add the artist and album columns to the Track model in models.py and document the technical debt of the service using raw SQL.
        Fix the TypeError in the /version endpoint by correcting the app_start_time definition in globals.py.

    Stabilize Testing (High Priority):
        Rewrite scripts/functional_test.py to use the correct API endpoint paths and assertions. All tests must pass before any new work is started.

    Perform Code & Repo Cleanup (Medium Priority):
        Delete the numerous leftover scripts from the api/ directory.
        Move bandit.yml to the repository root to fix the CI pipeline and update the API_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md accordingly.

    Proceed with Roadmap (Normal Priority):
        Once the system is stable, begin work on implementing the planned endpoints from endpoints.yaml as outlined in the newly updated ROADMAP.md
