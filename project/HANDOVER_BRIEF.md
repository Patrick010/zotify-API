# Handover Brief

**Project:** Zotify API Refactoring - Phase 3a
**Author:** Jules
**Date:** 2025-09-20

## 1. Context
This document outlines the context and next steps for the implementation of a JWT-based authentication system for the Zotify API. This is the first part of Phase 3 of the project roadmap.

## 2. Objective
The objective of Phase 3a was to refactor the user management system to use a database and to implement a robust JWT authentication system. This includes protecting user-specific endpoints and providing a secure way for users to register and log in.

## 3. Current Status & Plan
I have successfully completed the implementation of the JWT authentication system. The work was broken down into the following commits:

**Commit 1 – Refactor user_service to database**
- Added new database models for `UserProfile`, `UserPreferences`, `LikedSong`, and `History`.
- Added new CRUD functions for these models.
- Refactored `user_service` to use the new database models and CRUD functions.
- Wrote unit tests for the new `user_service` functions.

**Commit 2 – Add JWT authentication routes**
- Created `/register` and `/login` endpoints.
- Implemented password hashing and JWT signing/validation logic in `jwt_service`.
- Added tests for registration and login.
- Integrated the `jwt_auth` router into the main FastAPI application.

**Commit 3 – Protect user endpoints with JWT**
- Updated user-related endpoints to use the `get_current_user` dependency.
- Updated `notifications_service` to be database-aware and use the new user model.
- Added tests for unauthorized access to protected endpoints.

All tests are currently passing.

## 4. Your Task:
The next step is to proceed with Phase 3b, which involves further enhancements to the user management system and the API as a whole. Please review the project roadmap for more details.
