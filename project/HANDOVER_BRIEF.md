Handover Brief: New Developer Tooling Proposals
1. Context

This work session was focused on expanding the project's long-term architectural vision, specifically regarding its developer tooling. The session began with a comprehensive onboarding process, which involved a deep review of all key project documents (PID, HLD, LLD, ALIGNMENT_MATRIX, BACKLOG, etc.). This provided a complete and up-to-date understanding of the project's current state, processes, and strategic goals before any new artifacts were created. The primary outcome of this session was the formal proposal of a more modular and extensible architecture for the project's developer tools.
2. Summary of Completed Work

The work performed was purely documentary and architectural. No source code was modified. The key accomplishments were:

    New Architectural Proposals Authored: Two new, detailed proposals were written and added to the project/proposals/ directory. These documents follow the established format and are intended to guide future development.
        DBSTUDIO_PLUGIN.md: This proposal outlines a plan to replace the current, tightly-coupled sqlite-web tool with a dynamic, backend-agnostic dbstudio plugin. This would make the database browser modular, role-aware, and compatible with production database systems like PostgreSQL.
        GONKUI_PLUGIN.md: This proposal details the conversion of the standalone GonkUI Flask application into a modular FastAPI plugin. The goal is to align the developer UI with the core API's architecture, decouple it from production code, and enable it to be loaded conditionally only in development environments.

    Integration with Living Documentation: The new proposals were woven into the project's existing governance framework to ensure they are properly tracked.
        Future Enhancements Updated: The project/FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md document was updated to include summaries of and links to the two new proposals, formally registering them as long-term project goals.
        Alignment Matrix Updated: The project/ALIGNMENT_MATRIX.md was updated with new tracking rows (AR-063, AR-064) for each proposal. This ensures that these proposed features are traceable from conception through to potential implementation and documentation.

3. System State at Time of Handover

    Functionality: The codebase is in a stable and clean state. As this session involved no changes to source code, all existing API functionality, tests, and supporting modules are unaffected and working as they were previously.
    Known Issues: There are no new known issues or regressions resulting from this work. The primary "issue" remains the large, but well-documented, gap between the current feature set and the ambitious long-term goals defined in the USECASES.md document.
    Governance: The project continues to operate under its strict, process-driven "living documentation" model. The creation and integration of these new proposals were performed in accordance with this model.

4. Next Immediate Steps & Recommendations

With the architectural vision for developer tooling now formally proposed, the next logical step is to ask the user for a new task.
