# Handover Brief

**Project:** Zotify API Refactoring
**Author:** Jules
**Date:** 2025-08-30

## 1. Context & Objectives

This work session was focused on a single, critical objective: to harden the project's "living documentation" policy by implementing a robust, self-aware, automated workflow.

The initial state of the project had several significant issues that undermined this policy:
*   The documentation linter was not "self-aware" and failed to detect unregistered files.
*   The central `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md` contained numerous errors, typos, and omissions.
*   The project and API documentation were mixed, violating the principle of separation of concerns.
*   Key startup scripts were broken.
*   Historical project logs had been accidentally damaged.

The goal of this session was to fix all of these issues and leave the project with a resilient, enforceable documentation process.

## 2. Summary of Accomplishments

A comprehensive series of tasks were completed to achieve the objective.

### 2.1. Linter Enhancement & Registry Cleanup
The `lint-docs.py` script was significantly upgraded. It now performs a **Registry Completeness Check**, scanning the entire repository and ensuring that every `.md` document and helper script is correctly registered in a registry file. This is a powerful new quality gate.

This new linter was then immediately used to perform an audit of the `PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`, which revealed dozens of errors. All of these errors were systematically fixed.

### 2.2. Dual-Registry System Implementation
Based on direct user feedback, the documentation system was refactored to use a dual-registry model:
*   `project/PROJECT_REGISTRY.md`: Now holds only high-level project management and audit documents.
*   `api/docs/REGISTRY.md`: A new file that now holds all documentation for the API, its sub-modules (`snitch`, `gonk-testUI`), and the helper scripts.

The linter was subsequently upgraded again to be aware of this new structure, and it now correctly validates files against both registries.

### 2.3. Tooling and Log Restoration
*   The `scripts/start.sh` script was repaired to correctly install `[dev]` dependencies, making the `mkdocs` documentation server functional.
*   The historical `SESSION_LOG.md` and `ACTIVITY.md` files, which had been damaged in a previous session, were successfully restored using `git restore`, bringing back the project's valuable history.

## 3. Final Project State

*   **Code:** The project is in a stable state. All work has been submitted for approval on the `feature/dual-registry-system` branch.
*   **Documentation:** The documentation is now highly accurate and correctly organized into a two-registry system. The automated linter now enforces that this structure is maintained.
*   **Verification:** The work was validated via a successful `request_code_review()` call, which passed with a "Correct" rating.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

A **persistent environment failure** was encountered at the very end of the session.
*   **Symptom:** The `run_in_bash_session` tool began consistently failing with "No such file or directory" errors, even for valid, top-level paths.
*   **Impact:** This prevented a final validation run of the test suite and the linter.
*   **Action for Next Developer:** The very first action should be to run these two commands from the project root to ensure the environment is stable:
    1.  `python scripts/lint-docs.py`
    2.  `cd api/ && APP_ENV=test python3 -m pytest`

## 5. Proposed Next Steps

The user asked a follow-up question that was not addressed due to the focus on fixing the registry system: **"will the newly written code and documentation that the developer just wrote also be checked on quality and be rated?"**

This is an excellent idea for the next logical feature. It would involve enhancing the automated workflow to integrate with the `CODE_QUALITY_INDEX.md` files. A potential implementation could be a new rule in the linter that:
1.  Detects a change to a source file (e.g., `api/src/zotify_api/services/tracks_service.py`).
2.  Reads the corresponding `CODE_QUALITY_INDEX.md`.
3.  Checks if the line for that source file has been modified in the same commit (i.e., its score or notes have been updated).
4.  Fails the commit if the quality index has not been updated, similar to how it currently fails if documentation is not updated.

This would fully close the loop on the quality assurance process.
