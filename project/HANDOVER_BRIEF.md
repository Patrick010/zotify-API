## Handover Brief: Code File Index Implementation Complete

### 1. Context

This work session focused on a critical governance and maintainability task: creating a canonical, authoritative registry of all code files within the repository. The goal was to improve developer discovery, provide a clear map of the codebase, and programmatically enforce the completeness of this new index to prevent future documentation drift. This task builds directly on the project's "Living Documentation" policy.

### 2. Summary of Completed Work

A new system for tracking code files has been fully implemented and integrated into the project's governance and CI/CD pipeline.

*   **New Artifact (`CODE_FILE_INDEX.md`):**
    *   A new index file was created at `api/docs/CODE_FILE_INDEX.md`.
    *   This file was meticulously populated with every code file (`.py`, `.js`, `.go`) from the `api/`, `scripts/`, `Gonk/`, and `snitch/` directories.
    *   Each entry is categorized by `Type` (e.g., Route, Model, Script, Core, Test) to provide at-a-glance context.

*   **New CI Validation Script (`validate_code_index.py`):**
    *   A new Python script was created at `scripts/validate_code_index.py`.
    *   This script automatically compares the contents of the `CODE_FILE_INDEX.md` against a live scan of the repository's directories.
    *   It is designed to fail if it discovers any code files that have not been registered in the index, or if the index contains entries for files that no longer exist.

*   **CI/CD Pipeline Integration:**
    *   The new `validate_code_index.py` script has been integrated into the `doc-linter` job in the main CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
    *   This makes the check a mandatory quality gate for all pull requests, ensuring the code index can never become stale.

*   **Governance and Process Updates:**
    *   **QA Policy:** The `project/QA_GOVERNANCE.md` file was updated with a new policy requiring the `CODE_FILE_INDEX.md` to be maintained.
    *   **Contribution Guidelines:** The `api/docs/manuals/API_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` was updated. A new step was added to the "Development Workflow" explicitly instructing contributors to update the `CODE_FILE_INDEX.md` whenever they add, remove, or rename a file.
    *   **Project Documentation:** The `api/docs/MASTER_INDEX.md` was updated to include a link to the new code index for discoverability. The `project/ALIGNMENT_MATRIX.md` was also updated to trace the new validation script to its corresponding design and governance documents.

### 3. System State at Time of Handover

*   **Functionality:** The project is in a highly stable state. All tests pass, and the new governance checks are fully functional. The codebase is now more navigable and maintainable than before.
*   **Known Issues:** The `mkdocs` build process continues to show several warnings related to un-indexed documentation files and a broken relative link. These are pre-existing issues that do not break the build but should be addressed in a future cleanup task.
