# Handover Brief

**Project:** Zotify API Refactoring 
**Author:** Jules 
**Date:** 2025-09-03

## 1. Context
This document outlines the context and next steps for a major project enhancement: the implementation of a new, professional-level QA Gate.

The project currently uses a simple, ad-hoc linter (`scripts/linter.py`) that enforces documentation-related rules. While effective for its narrow purpose, it does not perform any deep code quality analysis (e.g., complexity checks, mutation testing) and lacks comprehensive checks for documentation content and alignment.

A new, detailed specification has been provided to complement this system with a much more robust, multi-language QA Gate that is run at the end of project phases.

## 2. Objective
The overall objective is to implement the full QA Gate as defined in the user's specification. This will provide a professional, reliable, and transparent quality enforcement system for the entire repository.

## 3. Current Status & Plan
Given the large scope of the new QA Gate, the decision was made to implement it in a structured, phased approach. I have created a comprehensive, multi-phase plan that breaks down the work into manageable chunks.

This plan is located at: **`project/proposals/QA_GATE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`**.

The work on this proposal has been postponed to a later moment and must therefor be placed on the Future Enhancement list

## 4. Your Task: Place the Quality Gate on the Future Enhancement list with a meaningful description.
