# Handover Brief

**Project:** Zotify API Refactoring

This brief provides a summary of the most recent work and the current state of the project.
Recent Accomplishments

We are in th final phase 5 of an audit. Our goal of this session is to finalize this audit.
The last cycle of work focused on improving the project's CI/CD pipeline and developer tooling.

    Unified Linter & Logger: All pre-submission verification scripts and the log-work.py script have been consolidated into a single, intelligent Python script: scripts/linter.py. This script now handles all checks (linting, docs, tests) and automatically logs the work upon successful validation. This is now the canonical way to check and log work before committing, as documented in AGENTS.md.

    CI Pipeline Fix: The new linter script created a ModuleNotFoundError in the doc-linter CI job because it requires the PyYAML package. I have submitted a commit that fixes this by adding a pip install PyYAML step to the .github/workflows/ci.yml file. 

Current State & Next Steps

The repository is in a stable state. Even with the final CI fix submitted, the pipeline still returns errors that need fixing. Ask the user for the latest state.should be green.

The project is now in a good position to move on to the next task of in phase 5 of the audit as defined in project/audit/HLD_LLD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md. There are no other known blockers or critical tooling issues.
